/** Popularimeter
 * The purpose of this frame is to specify how good an audio file is. Many
 * interesting applications could be found to this frame such as a playlist
 * that features better audiofiles more often than others or it could be used
 * to profile a person's taste and find other 'good' files by comparing
 * people's profiles. The frame is very simple. It contains the email address
 * to the user, one rating byte and a four byte play counter, intended to be
 * increased with one for every time the file is played. The email is a
 * terminated string. The rating is 1-255 where 1 is worst and 255 is best.
 * 0 is unknown. If no personal counter is wanted it may be omitted. When the
 * counter reaches all one's, one byte is inserted in front of the counter
 * thus making the counter eight bits bigger in the same away as the play
 * counter ("PCNT"). There may be more than one "POPM" frame in each tag, but
 * only one with the same email address.
 *
 * <Header for 'Popularimeter', ID: "POPM">
 * Email to user <text string> $00
 * Rating $xx
 *Counter $xx xx xx xx (xx ...)
