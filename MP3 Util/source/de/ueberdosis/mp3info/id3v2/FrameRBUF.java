/** Recommended buffer size
 * Sometimes the server from which a audio file is streamed is aware of
 * transmission or coding problems resulting in interruptions in the audio
 * stream. In these cases, the size of the buffer can be recommended by the
 * server using this frame. If the 'embedded info flag' is true (1) then this
 * indicates that an ID3 tag with the maximum size described in 'Buffer size'
 * may occur in the audiostream. In such case the tag should reside between
 * two MPEG frames, if the audio is MPEG encoded. If the position of the next
 * tag is known, 'offset to next tag' may be used. The offset is calculated
 * from the end of tag in which this frame resides to the first byte of the
 * header in the next. This field may be omitted. Embedded tags are generally
 * not recommended since this could render unpredictable behaviour from
 * present software/hardware.
 *
 * For applications like streaming audio it might be an idea to embed tags
 * into the audio stream though. If the clients connects to individual
 * connections like HTTP and there is a possibility to begin every
 * transmission with a tag, then this tag should include a 'recommended
 * buffer size' frame. If the client is connected to a arbitrary point in the
 * stream, such as radio or multicast, then the 'recommended buffer size'
 * frame should be included in every tag. Every tag that is picked up after
 * the initial/first tag is to be considered as an update of the previous one.
 * E.g. if there is a "TIT2" frame in the first received tag and one in the
 * second tag, then the first should be 'replaced' with the second.
 *
 * The 'Buffer size' should be kept to a minimum. There may only be one
 * "RBUF" frame in each tag.
 *
