/** Attached Picture frame
 * This frame contains a picture directly related to the audio file. Image
 * format is the MIME type and subtype for the image. In the event that the
 * MIME media type name is omitted, "image/" will be implied. The "image/png"
 * or "image/jpeg" picture format should be used when interoperability is
 * wanted. Description is a short description of the picture, represented as
 * a terminated textstring. The description has a maximum length of 64
 * characters, but may be empty. There may be several pictures attached to
 * one file, each in their individual "APIC" frame, but only one with the
 * same content descriptor. There may only be one picture with the picture
 * type declared as picture type $01 and $02 respectively. There is the
 * possibility to put only a link to the image file by using the 'MIME type'
 * "-->" and having a complete URL instead of picture data. The use of linked
 * files should however be used sparingly since there is the risk of
 * separation of files.
