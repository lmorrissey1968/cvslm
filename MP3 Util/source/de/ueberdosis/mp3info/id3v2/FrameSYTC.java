/** Synchronised tempo codes
 * For a more accurate description of the tempo of a musical piece this
 * frame might be used. After the header follows one byte describing which
 * time stamp format should be used. Then follows one or more tempo codes.
 * Each tempo code consists of one tempo part and one time part. The tempo
 * is in BPM described with one or two bytes. If the first byte has the
 * value $FF, one more byte follows, which is added to the first giving a
 * range from 2 - 510 BPM, since $00 and $01 is reserved. $00 is used to
 * describe a beat-free time period, which is not the same as a music-free
 * time period. $01 is used to indicate one single beat-stroke followed by
 * a beat-free period.
 *
 * The tempo descriptor is followed by a time stamp. Every time the tempo
 * in the music changes, a tempo descriptor may indicate this for the
 * player. All tempo descriptors should be sorted in chronological order.
 * The first beat-stroke in a time-period is at the same time as the beat
 * description occurs. There may only be one "SYTC" frame in each tag.
 *
 * <Header for 'Synchronised tempo codes', ID: "SYTC">
 * Time stamp format $xx
 * Tempo data <binary data>
 *
 * Where time stamp format is:
 *
 * $01 Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG frames as unit
 * $02 Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit
 *
 * Abolute time means that every stamp contains the time from the
 * beginning of the file.
