/** Commercial frame
 * This frame enables several competing offers in the same tag by bundling
 * all needed information. That makes this frame rather complex but it's an
 * easier solution than if one tries to achieve the same result with several
 * frames. The frame begins, after the frame ID, size and encoding fields,
 * with a price string field. A price is constructed by one three character
 * currency code, encoded according to ISO-4217 alphabetic currency code,
 * followed by a numerical value where "." is used as decimal seperator. In
 * the price string several prices may be concatenated, seperated by a "/"
 * character, but there may only be one currency of each type.
 *
 * The price string is followed by an 8 character date string in the format
 * YYYYMMDD, describing for how long the price is valid. After that is a
 * contact URL, with which the user can contact the seller, followed by a one
 * byte 'received as' field. It describes how the audio is delivered when
 * bought according to the following list:
 *
 * $00 Other
 * $01 Standard CD album with other songs
 * $02 Compressed audio on CD
 * $03 File over the Internet
 * $04 Stream over the Internet
 * $05 As note sheets
 * $06 As note sheets in a book with other sheets
 * $07 Music on other media
 * $08 Non-musical merchandise
 *
 * Next follows a terminated string with the name of the seller followed by a
 * terminated string with a short description of the product. The last thing
 * is the ability to include a company logotype. The first of them is the
 * 'Picture MIME type' field containing information about which picture
 * format is used. In the event that the MIME media type name is omitted,
 * "image/" will be implied. Currently only "image/png" and "image/jpeg" are
 * allowed. This format string is followed by the binary picture data. This
 * two last fields may be omitted if no picture is to attach.
 *
