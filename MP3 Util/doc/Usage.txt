So you want to get information about an MP3 file...

That's quite easy if you just take a look at the constructor of ID3Reader:

First of all you open a file:

        RandomAccessFile in = new RandomAccessFile(filename,"r");

Then you get a first impression on the file including the ID3 (v1) tag and 
bitrates and layers and the like of the FIRST FRAME.

        xtag = readExtendedTag (in);

That helps a bit already but leaves too much to the imagination as VBR encoded
files definitely do not constantly use the bitrate of the first frame (sounds 
almost logical, doesn't it?). If you aren't quite sure that the file that is 
to be examined has a constant bitrate, you have to call

        checkAllFrames (in);

as it reads EVERY frame, therefore knowing the running time of the whole file.
This has to be called AFTER readExtendedTag () as it fills its information 
into the tag that has been created then.

Now, be nice and close the file:

        in.close ();



So, what does that mean? 

- The whole procedure is slow, each of the frames (a 10 minute song at 128 
  kbit has almost 50.000 frames) has to be read and analyzed. On a standard 
  PC (600 MHz Athlon) this takes some seconds.

- If you know a file is non-VBR you can skip checkAllFrames as long as you do 
  not want ID3v2 information (ID3v2-tag detection is done there as well).
