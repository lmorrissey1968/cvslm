Changes for 1.6.0d6
===================
All implemented classes have a copying constructor now. That removed a
bug that lead to a NoSuchMethodException.
Also some commenting has been completed.

Changes for 1.6.0d5
===================
Mainly the naming of the text-frames has been changed. FrameTEXT and FrameText aren't mistaken
by Windows anymore, as FrameText has been renamed to FrameT


Changes for 1.6.0d4
===================
A lot of work has been put into decoding ID3V2-Frames. So there are a lot of frames that
know what to do..

Changes for 1.6.0d3
===================
ID3V2 tags are no longer only examined by looking at their headers, but the
contained frames are decoded as far as they are implemented (only the basic 
ones as yet)

Notes
=====
The main change for most users is that they don't get bugged so much by debugging output.

The end user only sees the information that is basic to the file like bitrates (and the information in the ID3V1 tag, V2 tag information will be displayed in a future release)

Developers can set the level of debug output with a statement like this:
de.ueberdosis.util.OutputCtr.setLevel (0);
The level is a number between 0 and ... (normally 5, but sometimes I use more).


Changes for 1.6.0d2
===================
- new ID3Reader () first checks if a file is VBR before examining the whole file.
  Speeds things for fixed bitrate files hell up!

Changes for 1.6.0d1
===================

- ID3Reader doesn't cough and die when it encounters gibberish. It just skips it.
- ID3Writer.write () should not cause IOException: "negative seek offset" anymore
