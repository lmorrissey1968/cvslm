1
00:01:27,105 --> 00:01:29,108
Wake up the Americans

2
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:32,009
Hey!

3
00:03:16,414 --> 00:03:18,408
We live in a twilight world.

4
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:22,084
We live in a twilight world.

5
00:03:22,387 --> 00:03:23,671
And there are no friends at dusk.

6
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:26,855
You've been made. This siege is a blind for them to vanish you.

7
00:03:32,097 --> 00:03:33,997
I established contact.

8
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:37,502
Bring you in or kill you, I have 2 minutes, make up your mind.

9
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,900
Where's the package? - Coat-check.

10
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,601
Stay!

11
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,317
Grab his!

12
00:04:28,962 --> 00:04:31,544
What are you doing? What are you doing?

13
00:04:33,384 --> 00:04:35,535
Who are you? Who are you?

14
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:41,044
No friends at dusk, huh? - You'll do. Get him to the rally point.

15
00:05:13,232 --> 00:05:15,742
Swap clothes! Ukrainians are expecting a passenger.

16
00:05:16,318 --> 00:05:20,123
I've never seen an encapsulation like this. - We don't know how old it is, but It's the real deal.

17
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:23,826
Did you have an out? - A service tunnel to the sewer.

18
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:27,184
Take this. Take him. Take his exit. I don't trust ours anymore. Can you defuse that?

19
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:30,319
It is centrally synchronized. Are there more? - They're covering their tracks.

20
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,176
Take out the audience? - It's just the cheap seats.

21
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,212
That's not our mission. - It's mine now.

22
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,226
Walk away.

23
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:07,231
You don't have to kill these people.

24
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:22,084
That wasn't one of us. - I'll take the help.

25
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:26,255
Go, go, go, go, go!

26
00:06:39,354 --> 00:06:40,896
It's not our guy!

27
00:06:56,363 --> 00:06:59,693
A man can be trained to hold out for about 18 hours...

28
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:02,789
so your colleagues will be cleared by seven.

29
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:12,779
He didn't last 18 minutes. He didn't have anything to hide.

30
00:07:12,803 --> 00:07:14,812
You're smuggling a nobody.

31
00:07:17,815 --> 00:07:19,809
That's risky.

32
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,795
Or were you counting on this? Death.

33
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:29,814
CIA issue.

34
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,838
Spare yourself. Once they clear.

35
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:56,443
Almost seven, uh-oh.

36
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:03,864
It's running fast.

37
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:09,864
We have to put it back 1 hour.

38
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:31,880
Get it out!

39
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,911
Welcome to the afterlife.

40
00:08:57,555 --> 00:09:00,962
You've been in a medically induced coma

41
00:09:00,963 --> 00:09:03,890
while we got you out of Ukraine and rebuilt your mouth.

42
00:09:03,914 --> 00:09:09,905
The suicide pills were fake. Why?

43
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:12,927
A test. - A test?

44
00:09:16,252 --> 00:09:17,937
They pulled my teeth out.

45
00:09:19,603 --> 00:09:21,935
Did my team get clear?

46
00:09:22,693 --> 00:09:25,946
No. Private Russians, we think.

47
00:09:26,947 --> 00:09:28,948
Somebody talked.

48
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:34,947
Not you. You chose to die instead of giving up your colleagues.

49
00:09:43,957 --> 00:09:47,937
We all believe we'd run into the burning building.

50
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:51,946
But until we feel that heat, we can never know.

51
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,953
You do.

52
00:09:59,271 --> 00:10:03,972
I resign. - You don't work for us, you're dead.

53
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:09,977
Your duty transcends national interest. This is about survival.

54
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:13,989
Whose?

55
00:10:15,621 --> 00:10:16,994
Everyone's.

56
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:22,975
There's a cold war, cold as ice.

57
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:26,498
To even know It's true nature is to lose.

58
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,007
This is knowledge divided.

59
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:31,986
All I have for you is a gesture

60
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,001
in combination with a word. "Tenet".

61
00:10:37,514 --> 00:10:40,018
Use it carefully.

62
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:43,687
It'll open the right doors, but some of the wrong ones too.

63
00:10:43,754 --> 00:10:46,011
That's all they told you?

64
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:49,023
That test you passed?

65
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:51,031
Not everybody does.

66
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:08,658
With a high-vis vest and a clipboard you can get almost anywhere.

67
00:13:08,714 --> 00:13:13,158
Almost. â€“ An obscure tenet.

68
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:25,162
No small talk. Nothing that might reveal who we are or what we do.

69
00:13:25,186 --> 00:13:27,986
I thought I was here to find out what we do?

70
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:30,676
You're not here for "what", You're here for "how".

71
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:34,069
"What", is your department. That's not my business.

72
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:39,187
Well to do what I do, I need some idea of the threat we face.

73
00:13:41,602 --> 00:13:45,180
As I understand it, we are trying to prevent World War III.

74
00:13:45,204 --> 00:13:47,207
Nuclear holocaust?

75
00:13:47,295 --> 00:13:48,315
No.

76
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:51,961
Something worse.

77
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,931
Aim it and pull the trigger.

78
00:14:04,223 --> 00:14:07,206
It's empty. â€“ Aim it.

79
00:14:12,232 --> 00:14:15,218
Check the magazine.

80
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,805
How?

81
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:28,553
One of these bullets is like us, traveling forwards through time.

82
00:14:28,694 --> 00:14:31,667
The other one's going backwards.

83
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:33,699
Can you tell which is which?

84
00:14:35,784 --> 00:14:40,762
How about now? It's inverted. It's entropy runs backwards.

85
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,623
So to our eyes, its movement is reversed.

86
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:47,021
We think It's a type of inverse radiation triggered by nuclear fission.

87
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,638
You didn't make it? - No, we don't know how yet.

88
00:14:49,663 --> 00:14:53,273
So where'd it come from? - Someone's manufacturing them in the future.

89
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:56,333
They're streaming back at us. Try it.

90
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:07,269
You have to have dropped it.

91
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:22,279
How can it move before I touch it? - From your point of view, you caught it.

92
00:15:22,303 --> 00:15:26,465
But from the bullet's point of view, you dropped it. â€“ But cause comes before effect.

93
00:15:26,581 --> 00:15:29,512
No. That's just the way we see time.

94
00:15:29,552 --> 00:15:30,889
Well, what about free will?

95
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:34,093
That bullet wouldn't have moved if you hadn't put your hand there.

96
00:15:34,152 --> 00:15:38,295
Either way we run the tape, you made it happen.

97
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:40,320
don't try to understand it.

98
00:15:41,321 --> 00:15:43,319
Feel it.

99
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:55,336
Instinct.

100
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:56,901
Got it.

101
00:16:01,782 --> 00:16:03,784
Why does it feel so strange?

102
00:16:05,026 --> 00:16:07,011
You're not shooting the bullet.

103
00:16:07,348 --> 00:16:10,335
You're catching it.

104
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
Whoa

105
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,705
I've seen this type of ammunition before. - In the field?

106
00:16:17,816 --> 00:16:21,513
I was almost hit. - Then you were exceedingly lucky.

107
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:25,555
An inverted bullet passing through your body would be devastating. Not pretty.

108
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,334
These look like today's. - They may have been made today and inverted years from now.

109
00:16:31,218 --> 00:16:33,202
Where did you get them? - They came with the wall.

110
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:36,050
I was assigned it, like all the material I'm studying here.

111
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:39,726
Do you have an analysis on the metals? - Sure. Why?

112
00:16:39,752 --> 00:16:43,753
The mixture of alloys can tell me where they have might have been made. Look...

113
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:46,989
I'm not seeing Armageddon here.

114
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:51,917
The bullet may not seem like much but It's a simple machine.

115
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:54,966
Lead bullet, brass casing, gunpowder.

116
00:16:55,526 --> 00:16:59,055
If they can invert that, we see no reason they couldn't invert pretty much anything.

117
00:16:59,244 --> 00:17:02,247
Even a nuclear weapon can only affect our future.

118
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:05,829
An inverted weapon might be able to affect our past as well.

119
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:13,533
Now that we know what to look for, We're finding more and more inverted material.

120
00:17:13,557 --> 00:17:16,554
Remnants of complex objects.

121
00:17:20,437 --> 00:17:22,451
What do you think We're seeing?

122
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,920
The detritus of a coming war.

123
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,526
Yup? We live in a twilight world.

124
00:17:47,572 --> 00:17:49,560
No friends at dusk. I was told you left the building.

125
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,571
Even the dead need allies. - Specifically?

126
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:56,075
I need an assist in Mumbai. I need to get to Sanjay Singh.

127
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:59,393
Singh? He never leaves his house, and his house is... his house.

128
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:03,583
Yes it is. I'm looking right at it. - I'll see who's on deck.

129
00:18:04,076 --> 00:18:06,077
Bombay Yacht Club in two hours.

130
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:22,624
Seems you need an introduction to a prominent Mumbai local on short notice.

131
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:28,612
I'm Neil. - I need an audience with Sanjay Singh.

132
00:18:29,627 --> 00:18:33,612
That's not possible. - Ten minutes, tops.

133
00:18:33,636 --> 00:18:36,606
Time isn't the problem.

134
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,622
Getting out alive is the problem.

135
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:44,939
Would you take a child hostage? A woman?

136
00:18:45,314 --> 00:18:48,617
If I had to. I'm not looking to make much noise here.

137
00:18:48,831 --> 00:18:52,642
Yes? - Vodka tonic. And a diet Coke.

138
00:18:54,653 --> 00:18:56,635
What?

139
00:18:56,659 --> 00:19:00,645
You never drink on the job. - You're well informed.

140
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,703
It pays to be in our profession. - Well I prefer soda water.

141
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:10,636
No, you don't.

142
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,641
How's your parachuting? - I broke an ankle during basic training.

143
00:19:14,665 --> 00:19:17,649
Singh's house isn't tall enough to parachute off of.

144
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:21,650
It's bungee-jumpable. - I don't think "bungee-jumpable" is a word.

145
00:19:21,674 --> 00:19:24,672
It may not be a word but it may be our only way out of that place.

146
00:19:25,683 --> 00:19:27,681
Or into it for that matter.

147
00:21:10,584 --> 00:21:11,004
Hey!

148
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:13,409
Stay back.

149
00:21:14,084 --> 00:21:17,965
I was almost taken out by a very unusual type of ammunition in Ukraine.

150
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,013
I want to know who supplied it.

151
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:23,995
My name is Sanjay. And you are?

152
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:25,584
No chit-chat?

153
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:30,584
There's no one at the other end. No one who's going to help you anyway.

154
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:33,050
don't let it get cold.

155
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,220
Why should I know who supplied it?

156
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,861
The combination of metals is unique to India. If It's from India, It's from you.

157
00:21:41,886 --> 00:21:43,178
Fine assumption. - Deduction.

158
00:21:43,466 --> 00:21:46,885
Deduction then. Look, my friend.

159
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:52,044
Guns are never conducive to a productive negotiation. - I'm not the man they send to negotiate.

160
00:21:54,031 --> 00:21:59,034
Or the man they send to make deals. But I am the man people talk to.

161
00:22:00,638 --> 00:22:03,193
I can'tâ€¦ I can't tell you.

162
00:22:03,246 --> 00:22:07,060
You're an arms dealer, friend. This may be the easiest trigger I've ever had to pull.

163
00:22:07,787 --> 00:22:11,793
To say anything about a client would violate the tenets he lives by.

164
00:22:13,003 --> 00:22:17,829
If tenets are important to you, then you can tell me. Everything.

165
00:22:17,882 --> 00:22:20,995
Not while you have a gun to my husband's head.

166
00:22:21,067 --> 00:22:24,068
Sanjay, make a drink for our guest please.

167
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,076
Cheers. Priya.

168
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:31,042
This is your operation.

169
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:34,049
A masculine front in a man's world has its uses.

170
00:22:34,073 --> 00:22:37,244
The dealer you are looking for is Andrei Sator. - The Russian oligarch.

171
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:41,800
Do you know him? - Not personally. Made his billions in gas.

172
00:22:41,825 --> 00:22:45,069
Moved to London, said to be on the outs with Moscow.

173
00:22:45,093 --> 00:22:50,075
Very good. Except the gas he made his billions from was actually plutonium.

174
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:54,077
None of which explains how or why you sold him inverted munitions?

175
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:56,697
When I sold him the arms they were perfectly ordinary.

176
00:22:56,795 --> 00:22:59,083
So how did he get them inverted?

177
00:22:59,107 --> 00:23:04,109
We believe he's functioning as some sort of a broker between our time and the future.

178
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:09,089
He can communicate with the future? - We all do, don't we.

179
00:23:09,113 --> 00:23:11,093
Emails, credit cards, texts.

180
00:23:11,117 --> 00:23:14,820
Anything that goes into the records speaks directly to the future.

181
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:21,110
The question is, can the future speak back? - And I'm supposed to find out?

182
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:25,138
To get anywhere near Sator will take a fresh-faced protagonist.

183
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:27,936
And you are fresh as a daisy.

184
00:23:28,127 --> 00:23:32,042
Get close, find out what he's receiving and how.

185
00:23:32,067 --> 00:23:37,128
Is it safe to involve British Intelligence? - I have a contact, who's out of Sator's reach.

186
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:44,882
You must have had a plan for getting out.

187
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:47,669
Not one I love.

188
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,601
May I help you sir? Mr. Crosby's lunch.

189
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:17,610
I presume you mean â€œSirâ€� Michael Crosby's lunch. - Presumably.

190
00:24:17,634 --> 00:24:19,639
If You'll follow me.

191
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,169
I started without you. Hope you don't mind.

192
00:24:27,193 --> 00:24:29,176
I'll catch up.

193
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,715
Same for me, please. - I'll send the waiter.

194
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,183
No, just pass on the order.

195
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:37,335
I gather you have an interest in a certain Russian national.

196
00:24:37,366 --> 00:24:40,178
Anglo-Russian, so I have to watch my step.

197
00:24:40,202 --> 00:24:44,815
Indeed, he's tapped into the intelligence services. I've warned them he's feeding them rubbish,

198
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,727
but they don't seem to care - Tell me about him.

199
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:52,764
I assume You're familiar with the Soviet-era secret cities.

200
00:24:53,219 --> 00:24:57,198
Closed cities, not shown on maps, built around sensitive industries.

201
00:24:57,222 --> 00:25:02,206
Most of them have been opened up and renamed as regular towns. - Not the one Sator grew up in.

202
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:07,201
Stalsk 12. In the seventies it had a population of about 200,000.

203
00:25:07,225 --> 00:25:09,209
Thought to be abandoned. - Abandoned?

204
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:13,246
Had some kind of accident. After which it was used for underground tests.

205
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:16,687
Two weeks ago, the same day as the Kiev Opera siege,

206
00:25:16,795 --> 00:25:22,213
we spotted a detonation in northern Siberia just where Stalsk 12 was.

207
00:25:22,237 --> 00:25:25,235
Sator emerged from this blackspot on the map...

208
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:30,264
with ambition and enough money to buy his way into the British establishment.

209
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:34,828
Through his wife? - Katherine Barton. Eldest niece of Sir Fredrick Barton.

210
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:37,239
She works at Shipley's. Met Sator at an auction.

211
00:25:37,264 --> 00:25:40,249
Happy marriage? - Practically estranged.

212
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:42,879
Well, how do I get to Sator? - Through her of course.

213
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:46,252
Well, you may have an inflated idea of my powers of seduction.

214
00:25:46,276 --> 00:25:48,256
Hardly.

215
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,282
We have an ace in the hole.

216
00:25:53,282 --> 00:25:55,684
You're carrying a Goya in a Harrods bag?

217
00:25:55,709 --> 00:25:58,690
It's a fake by a Spaniard named Arepo.

218
00:25:58,778 --> 00:26:01,925
One of the two we confiscated from an embezzler in Bern.

219
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:03,214
What happened to the other one?

220
00:26:03,292 --> 00:26:06,092
It turned up at Shipley's. Authenticated by Katherine Barton.

221
00:26:06,427 --> 00:26:07,921
Put on auction,

222
00:26:08,028 --> 00:26:11,283
and who do you think bought it? - Her husband?

223
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:16,284
Does she know it's a forgery? - Oh, it's hard to say.

224
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:22,295
Rumor has it, that she and Arepo were close. - A-ah

225
00:26:22,674 --> 00:26:24,658
Look, no offence,

226
00:26:25,189 --> 00:26:28,202
but in this world where someone is claiming to be a billionaire,

227
00:26:30,071 --> 00:26:32,056
Brooks Brothers won't cut it.

228
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:37,301
I'm assuming I'm on a budget. - Save the world, then we'll balance the books.

229
00:26:37,325 --> 00:26:40,305
Can I recommend a tailor? - I'll manage.

230
00:26:40,329 --> 00:26:42,479
You British don't have a monopoly on snobbery you know.

231
00:26:42,504 --> 00:26:46,473
- Well, not a monopoly. More of a controlling interest.

232
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:50,505
Can you box that up for me? - Certainly not.

233
00:26:51,584 --> 00:26:53,584
Goodbye, Sir Michael.

234
00:27:25,584 --> 00:27:28,366
How can I help sir?

235
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:33,281
Sorry, I wasn't notified of any appointments, Mr...?

236
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:36,360
Goya.

237
00:27:36,384 --> 00:27:40,380
Mr. Goya? - No, I'm told You're the person to see about Goya.

238
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:43,607
That's extraordinary.

239
00:27:48,926 --> 00:27:51,897
What's it worth?

240
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:53,934
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

241
00:27:55,036 --> 00:27:59,022
Lots of work to do before any kind of valuation.

242
00:27:59,358 --> 00:28:03,010
Provenance, microscopic examination, X-raysâ€¦

243
00:28:03,123 --> 00:28:05,127
But what does your heart tell you?

244
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,422
So where did you say you acquired this drawing? - Tomas Arepo.

245
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:20,173
I bought my Goya for cents on the dollar from an irate Swiss banker.

246
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:23,411
Traced it back to Arepo and then realized I had scored a bargain,

247
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:26,318
when he told me who paid top dollar for another one of his pictures.

248
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:28,350
Your husband. - Where's your bargain?

249
00:28:28,816 --> 00:28:31,607
Your drawing's an obvious fake. - My drawing's a very good fake.

250
00:28:31,741 --> 00:28:35,736
You know that better than anyone. The information's the bargain.

251
00:28:36,444 --> 00:28:38,948
The information that I helped defraud my own husband?

252
00:28:38,973 --> 00:28:41,956
He and I are in related businesses, but he's a very hard man to meet.

253
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,156
If you and I were to make an arrangement... - An arrangement?

254
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:48,016
You mean blackmail? Don't be afraid of the word.

255
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:52,021
My husband isn't. I'm sorry to tell you he got there first.

256
00:28:52,046 --> 00:28:54,025
He knows, and he's never done anything about it?

257
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,763
Why would he? - He paid 9 million dollars for it.

258
00:28:56,788 --> 00:29:00,788
Barely cover the cost for the holiday he just forced us on. - Where'd you go? Mars?

259
00:29:01,994 --> 00:29:04,990
Vietnam on our yacht. His yacht.

260
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,303
You've got the suit, the shoes, the watch,

261
00:29:09,478 --> 00:29:12,329
But you're a little out of your depth.

262
00:29:12,354 --> 00:29:15,341
People who've amassed fortunes like your husband's...

263
00:29:15,427 --> 00:29:19,421
generally aren't okay with being cheated out of any of it.

264
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:27,484
The drawing is his hold over me.

265
00:29:30,945 --> 00:29:35,950
He threatened me with police. Prison. The works.

266
00:29:38,326 --> 00:29:40,305
He controls me.

267
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,973
The contact with my son. Everything.

268
00:29:43,145 --> 00:29:47,158
Leaving would never have been easy, but now it's impossible.

269
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,695
You can't fight.

270
00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:52,140
Just beg.

271
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:56,787
In Vietnam I tried to love him again.

272
00:29:56,811 --> 00:29:59,798
I thought if there was love there he might give me my son back.

273
00:29:59,822 --> 00:30:03,809
We sat on that bloody boat watching the sunset,

274
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:06,797
imitating some earlier time in our lives.

275
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:11,806
He seemed happy so I asked him, and he made me an offer.

276
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:15,836
He'd let me go, if I agreed never to see my son again.

277
00:30:18,218 --> 00:30:21,635
I expressed myself, and took Max ashore.

278
00:30:21,774 --> 00:30:23,770
He called us, contrite.

279
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:29,567
And when we got back, I glimpsed some other woman diving off the boat, and then vanished.

280
00:30:31,851 --> 00:30:35,287
I never felt such envy. - You don't seem the jealous type.

281
00:30:35,312 --> 00:30:38,296
Of her freedom.

282
00:30:40,499 --> 00:30:43,164
You know how I dream of just diving off that boat?

283
00:30:43,544 --> 00:30:45,426
But you share a son.

284
00:30:45,582 --> 00:30:47,849
That's my life now.

285
00:30:48,285 --> 00:30:50,850
Did you know the drawing was a fake? - No.

286
00:30:50,874 --> 00:30:54,849
Tomas and I became close, maybe too close. I failed.

287
00:30:54,873 --> 00:30:59,405
Andrei can't conceive of failure. Only betrayal. But I didn't betray my husband.

288
00:30:59,502 --> 00:31:03,859
In retrospect, maybe I missed my chance. - And he let Arepo walk free.

289
00:31:03,883 --> 00:31:08,859
If you had actually met Arepo, as you claimed, you'd understand that he no longer walksâ€¦ anywhere.

290
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:11,875
We spoke on the phone. - He can't do that either.

291
00:31:11,899 --> 00:31:13,877
Where's the drawing? - Why?

292
00:31:13,901 --> 00:31:17,518
Get me an introduction. I'll take the drawing out of the equation.

293
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:20,880
No picture, no prosecution, no more hold over you.

294
00:31:20,904 --> 00:31:24,885
I might just be your second chance. - I don't need redemption.

295
00:31:24,909 --> 00:31:26,918
At betrayal.

296
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:34,887
Friends of your husband's?

297
00:31:34,911 --> 00:31:38,890
You knew this was going to happen? - Don't worry, they won't kill you.

298
00:31:38,914 --> 00:31:41,897
Andrei dislikes tangling with local law enforcement on that level.

299
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:45,319
You must have really not liked the look of me. - The look was fine.

300
00:31:45,348 --> 00:31:49,902
It's best to get to the nasty part before I care one way or the other.

301
00:31:49,926 --> 00:31:53,913
There's a number in your left coat pocket. Don't call from home.

302
00:31:53,937 --> 00:31:55,947
You won't be taking my call.

303
00:31:57,805 --> 00:31:59,821
I might surprise you.

304
00:32:30,561 --> 00:32:34,546
I ordered my hot sauce an hour ago.

305
00:32:35,878 --> 00:32:37,131
Can we get going?

306
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:53,876
Please! - He wants you to see.

307
00:32:53,876 --> 00:33:19,829
<b><i>This Movie Is Downloaded From "MSMOVIESBD.COM"</i></b>

308
00:33:19,829 --> 00:33:21,030
And he gets what he wants.

309
00:33:28,654 --> 00:33:30,656
Not always apparently.

310
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,339
Anna says We're going to Pompeii and see lava.

311
00:33:39,439 --> 00:33:44,423
We will. We'll go together. I'll be there too.

312
00:34:03,453 --> 00:34:06,444
I told you I'd surprise you.

313
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:08,790
He's a cute kid. - He's everything.

314
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,050
Where's the drawing?

315
00:34:13,074 --> 00:34:16,075
Oslo, at the airport. - The airport?

316
00:34:16,677 --> 00:34:18,198
Do you know what a Freeport is?

317
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:23,456
A storage facility for art that was acquiredâ€¦ - But not yet taxed.

318
00:34:23,685 --> 00:34:25,673
He started a network.

319
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:29,099
Rotas, his construction company, built them. I brought in the clients.

320
00:34:29,689 --> 00:34:31,393
The facilities are tax havens.

321
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:33,863
The clients can view their investments without

322
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:36,107
importing them, so they avoid paying tax.

323
00:34:36,717 --> 00:34:38,708
So It's sort of like a transit lounge for art?

324
00:34:39,034 --> 00:34:42,045
Art, antiquities, anything of value really. - Anything?

325
00:34:42,451 --> 00:34:46,563
Anything legal. - But it's not unlike the Swiss banking system.

326
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:48,579
Opaque.

327
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:53,093
As I'm sure you are aware, most Freeports are just warehouses,

328
00:34:53,117 --> 00:34:56,092
but here we ensure that you can enjoy...

329
00:34:56,116 --> 00:34:58,475
Rotas has assets in the Oslo Freeport. I'm guessing It's there.

330
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,129
And this way to the vaults.

331
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:02,204
Guessing? - Guessing?

332
00:35:02,229 --> 00:35:04,712
We make trips there four, five times a year.

333
00:35:04,737 --> 00:35:07,035
To view art? - And whatever it is he does.

334
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:11,140
Turns out art's of no importance to Andrei. - But the Freeports are.

335
00:35:13,133 --> 00:35:15,470
The structure of the vaults is based on the Pentagon.

336
00:35:15,495 --> 00:35:18,118
Each vault a separate structure within the other.

337
00:35:18,142 --> 00:35:21,137
Damage to one structure won't compromise the other.

338
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,168
Some customers choose biometric access control. You can go straight in...

339
00:35:38,158 --> 00:35:39,170
Off the tarmac.

340
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:41,829
From the terminal?

341
00:35:41,854 --> 00:35:44,858
From their private planes. - Of course.

342
00:35:45,988 --> 00:35:48,734
Our logistics department ships to and from any other

343
00:35:48,759 --> 00:35:51,657
Freeport in the world without customs inspection.

344
00:35:52,173 --> 00:35:55,160
What are you hoping to find in there? - Do you really want to know?

345
00:35:55,184 --> 00:35:59,156
I'm not sure. - Bring some lead-lined gloves.

346
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,164
Jesus, it' s nuclear?

347
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:06,196
When You're on the tour, pay attention to the fire precautions.

348
00:36:08,188 --> 00:36:11,158
Documents are vulnerable to... - Fire, absolutely?

349
00:36:11,183 --> 00:36:13,170
I was going to say, water damage from sprinkler systems.

350
00:36:13,194 --> 00:36:15,177
We don't use sprinklers.

351
00:36:15,201 --> 00:36:20,606
The facility is flooded with Halide gas, displacing all the air within seconds.

352
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:25,195
Can you show me? - Well if I did, we'd suffocate.

353
00:36:26,202 --> 00:36:28,532
What about the staff? - Halide only fills the vaults,

354
00:36:28,577 --> 00:36:32,848
they just have to get into either corridor. And there is a 10 second warning.

355
00:36:32,912 --> 00:36:34,894
At least you give them 10 seconds.

356
00:36:35,094 --> 00:36:39,153
Well sir, our clients use us, because we have no priorities

357
00:36:39,178 --> 00:36:41,202
above their property.

358
00:36:41,226 --> 00:36:42,121
Blimey.

359
00:36:42,146 --> 00:36:44,921
All doors are fireproof. Hydraulic closers.

360
00:36:44,922 --> 00:36:46,904
Simple key and electronic triggers.

361
00:36:46,929 --> 00:36:48,491
Surprisingly easy once they have been locked down.

362
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,208
Why a lockdown? - The power switches to fail-safe, securing the outer doors.

363
00:36:53,233 --> 00:36:56,247
But the inner doors revert to factory settings.

364
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,413
You can pick the locks. Its child's play really.

365
00:36:59,438 --> 00:37:01,899
Child's play? You're inside airport security.

366
00:37:01,924 --> 00:37:05,029
They have to worry about climate control, not armed raids.

367
00:37:05,054 --> 00:37:09,910
So how do we get enough firepower through the perimeter to trigger their lockdown procedure?

368
00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:14,058
The back wall of the Freeport. - You've got something?

369
00:37:14,989 --> 00:37:16,969
You're not gonna like it.

370
00:37:17,257 --> 00:37:19,240
You want to crash a plane?

371
00:37:19,264 --> 00:37:21,498
Well, not from the air. don't be so dramatic.

372
00:37:21,687 --> 00:37:26,692
I want to run a jet off the taxi-way, breach through the wall, and start a fire.

373
00:37:28,751 --> 00:37:30,736
Well, how big a plane?

374
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:34,911
Well, that part is a little dramatic.

375
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:39,255
This is Mahir. His team will work the plane.

376
00:37:39,279 --> 00:37:42,132
There can't be passengers. - Norsk Freight.

377
00:37:42,157 --> 00:37:46,881
They use the hangar on the west side of the Freeport. - You want to crash a transport plane? What about the crew?

378
00:37:46,906 --> 00:37:49,887
We pop the slides, chuck â€˜em off. - On the move?

379
00:37:50,051 --> 00:37:52,043
What's the problem, they'll be fine.

380
00:37:52,302 --> 00:37:54,276
Well it seemsâ€¦ bold.

381
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,277
"Bold" I'm fine with. I thought you were gonna say "nuts".

382
00:37:57,301 --> 00:37:59,282
And if you get caught? - We won't.

383
00:37:59,306 --> 00:38:01,285
And if you do?

384
00:38:01,309 --> 00:38:04,288
Everyone assumes terrorism, but no one's died, so

385
00:38:04,312 --> 00:38:08,318
a swift extradition, then lost in the system. It'll barely make the news.

386
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:13,298
That all depends on the size of your explosion. - Well actually the gold bars might get some play.

387
00:38:13,323 --> 00:38:17,138
Gold bars? - Norsk Freight ships treasury gold once a month.

388
00:38:17,163 --> 00:38:20,307
Blow the back, drop it out on the runway.

389
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:24,321
No one will be looking at the building. I guarantee you.

390
00:38:27,081 --> 00:38:31,066
The space in this inner pentagon is too big. There's something there.

391
00:38:31,335 --> 00:38:35,320
I can't figure it out, It's just not marked.

392
00:38:35,344 --> 00:38:37,675
It's 45 seconds. - Ample.

393
00:38:37,997 --> 00:38:40,008
Won't you be running?

394
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:43,964
All right, it's your turn. Start packing.

395
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:03,358
Gentlemen, if you would, through the detector please.

396
00:39:07,274 --> 00:39:10,576
Sir, and Sir.

397
00:39:19,181 --> 00:39:23,164
Can I offer you perhaps a coffee? A water? - I'll take an espresso.

398
00:39:23,393 --> 00:39:27,382
Sir? - No thank you.

399
00:39:35,818 --> 00:39:40,628
Is everybody on this plane vegetarian? Cause all I got here is vegetarian.

400
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:46,853
So that one looks like meat, but I think that looks vegetarian. I think they both look vegetarian.

401
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:51,219
I don't know. Confusing, you know. Okay.

402
00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:00,016
This way, gentlemen.

403
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:18,428
Gentlemen, your central...

404
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:30,461
Carry on. Not the radio.

405
00:40:37,463 --> 00:40:39,465
Come on.

406
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:10,680
Yoga.

407
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,269
Let's go! Now!

408
00:41:47,535 --> 00:41:48,536
Go, go, go.

409
00:42:24,073 --> 00:42:26,078
All right, I...

410
00:42:40,712 --> 00:42:42,711
You said ten seconds, right?

411
00:44:03,202 --> 00:44:05,371
There's someone in here with us.

412
00:44:19,814 --> 00:44:23,800
Do you need a hand? - Actually, yes.

413
00:44:49,822 --> 00:44:53,341
Don't touch them! -The hell happened here?

414
00:44:58,979 --> 00:45:00,991
It hasn't happened yet.

415
00:47:19,995 --> 00:47:21,576
don't kill him!

416
00:47:21,601 --> 00:47:24,983
We need to know if We've been compromised.

417
00:47:26,209 --> 00:47:30,984
Why are you here? Who are you?

418
00:47:31,008 --> 00:47:33,001
How'd you know we'd be here?

419
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:50,075
We need to go.

420
00:47:54,493 --> 00:47:56,495
What happened to the other guy?

421
00:47:57,089 --> 00:47:59,092
I took care of him.

422
00:48:14,098 --> 00:48:18,085
Well, I've seen too much. I'm still alive, which must mean you've decided to trust me.

423
00:48:18,109 --> 00:48:22,451
Or maybe I've lost my edge? - Your edge is still intact.

424
00:48:23,948 --> 00:48:26,930
There's a Cold War. - Nuclear?

425
00:48:27,111 --> 00:48:29,131
Temporal.

426
00:48:30,113 --> 00:48:32,103
Time travel? - No.

427
00:48:32,127 --> 00:48:35,896
Technology that can invert an object 's entropy.

428
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:41,844
You mean reverse chronology, like Feynman and Wheeler's notion that a positron's an electron moving backwards in time?

429
00:48:41,887 --> 00:48:45,162
Sure, that's exactly what I meant. - I have a Masters in Physics.

430
00:48:45,187 --> 00:48:48,348
Well, try and keep up. - I mean the implications of this are...

431
00:48:48,373 --> 00:48:50,962
Beyond secret. - Then why did you bring me in?

432
00:48:50,987 --> 00:48:53,755
I thought we'd find a drawing and a couple boxes of bullets.

433
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:58,153
Not as surprised as I was. - I'm going back to Mumbai to get some answers.

434
00:48:59,546 --> 00:49:02,162
I'll set you up as a go-between, but remember to you...

435
00:49:03,165 --> 00:49:06,135
It's all about plutonium.

436
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:10,148
Or when we're done, they'll kill you. - Won't you have to do that anyway?

437
00:49:10,172 --> 00:49:15,162
I rather that be my decision. - So would I. I think.

438
00:49:27,596 --> 00:49:30,049
Your work?

439
00:49:31,024 --> 00:49:32,810
What did you find in the vaults?

440
00:49:32,835 --> 00:49:35,664
Two antagonists. One inverted.

441
00:49:35,787 --> 00:49:39,635
We took out the regular one, but the inverted one got away.

442
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:42,651
Both emerged at the same moment? - Yeah.

443
00:49:43,186 --> 00:49:44,203
They were the same person.

444
00:49:45,205 --> 00:49:49,170
Sator has built a Turnstile in that vault. - A Turnstile?

445
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:51,589
A machine, for inverting.

446
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:54,184
You told me that technology hasn't been invented yet.

447
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:58,196
It hasn't, he's been given it by the future. - For what?

448
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:01,215
You have the best chance of finding out.

449
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:03,569
Have you met him? - I was close.

450
00:50:04,207 --> 00:50:07,904
What if you have something he needs? - Such as?

451
00:50:07,929 --> 00:50:10,197
Plutonium-241.

452
00:50:10,221 --> 00:50:15,979
Sator tried to lift the only used 241 from under a CIA team at the opera siege in Kiev.

453
00:50:16,004 --> 00:50:19,107
He got the team. Not the 241.

454
00:50:19,132 --> 00:50:22,205
Who did? - Ukrainian security services.

455
00:50:22,229 --> 00:50:24,218
It's moving to Tallinn in a week.

456
00:50:24,242 --> 00:50:29,245
Helping an arms dealer steal weapons grade plutonium is unacceptable, Priya.

457
00:50:30,238 --> 00:50:33,937
I'm just gonna take him out. - No, no, no, no. No, Sator has to stay alive.

458
00:50:33,962 --> 00:50:36,939
He has to stay alive until we know his part in things.

459
00:50:36,964 --> 00:50:40,856
Manage the situation without losing control of the 241.

460
00:50:40,881 --> 00:50:42,227
It's too dangerous.

461
00:50:42,251 --> 00:50:47,418
A terrorist bomb, even one that can kill billions, is nothing compared to what could happen if you don't stop Sator.

462
00:50:47,443 --> 00:50:53,253
From doing what? - We are being attacked by the future.

463
00:50:53,972 --> 00:50:57,540
And Sator's helping. You have to find out how.

464
00:51:13,046 --> 00:51:15,458
I saw the news from Oslo. Do you have the drawing?

465
00:51:15,483 --> 00:51:19,655
You don't have to worry about it anymore. - You destroyed it?

466
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,542
I didn't think you'd want it back. - Does he know?

467
00:51:22,567 --> 00:51:25,277
Not yet. So sit tight. - Sit tight?

468
00:51:25,301 --> 00:51:28,273
Every day my son spends with that monster, he thinks a little less of me.

469
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:32,287
It won't be long. In the meantime, introduce me.

470
00:51:32,311 --> 00:51:36,911
As what? - I'm a former first secretary from the American Embassy in Riyadh.

471
00:51:36,936 --> 00:51:40,285
We met at party last June. - We were at a party in Riyadh, but I don't think it was in June.

472
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:42,716
June 29, 7 to 7.30

473
00:51:42,741 --> 00:51:45,298
Salmon was on the printed menu, swapped for sea bass on the night.

474
00:51:45,322 --> 00:51:49,098
Sator left early, That's when we met. I came into Shipley's in London.

475
00:51:49,123 --> 00:51:52,302
You ran into me here, and want to show me your yacht.

476
00:51:52,326 --> 00:51:55,940
He'll think we're having an affair. - Then he'll want to meet me.

477
00:51:55,965 --> 00:51:58,952
Or have you killed. - Let me worry about that.

478
00:51:59,328 --> 00:52:01,323
Did I look worried?

479
00:52:02,341 --> 00:52:06,736
Sleeps 70 with crew. Two helicopters. Missile defenses.

480
00:52:06,761 --> 00:52:10,662
Afraid of pirates? - Andrei lives playing one government off the other.

481
00:52:10,863 --> 00:52:12,752
Till they turn, That's his refuge.

482
00:52:12,777 --> 00:52:16,330
May I join you? - Not sure Volkov's taking passengers just now.

483
00:52:16,354 --> 00:52:18,348
Then we'll take mine.

484
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,238
Max?

485
00:52:54,884 --> 00:52:57,378
Who's the American?

486
00:52:58,388 --> 00:53:01,876
He's a friend. - The man from Shipley's.

487
00:53:02,402 --> 00:53:05,387
That you tried to have beaten up.

488
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:08,070
I ask again. Who is he?

489
00:53:10,997 --> 00:53:13,920
We met in Riyadh last June at the American Embassy.

490
00:53:13,945 --> 00:53:18,391
Good with fists for a diplomat. - Paranoia is your department, Andrei.

491
00:53:18,415 --> 00:53:21,421
He seems nice. I invited him to the dinner.

492
00:53:21,914 --> 00:53:26,213
Max? â€“ He's visiting Pompeii and Herculaneum.

493
00:53:26,413 --> 00:53:30,408
You just sent him off? I promised him I'd go with him.

494
00:53:30,432 --> 00:53:33,343
I explained you were busy.

495
00:53:34,425 --> 00:53:36,435
With your friend.

496
00:53:57,759 --> 00:54:01,763
Hey, easy fella. Where I'm from, you buy me dinner first.

497
00:54:12,471 --> 00:54:15,459
Mr. Sator. - don't bother.

498
00:54:16,475 --> 00:54:19,398
Just tell me if you've slept with my wife yet.

499
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:22,445
Ahhh, no.

500
00:54:22,469 --> 00:54:23,485
Not yet.

501
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,488
How would you like to die?

502
00:54:27,118 --> 00:54:30,135
Old. - You chose the wrong profession.

503
00:54:32,485 --> 00:54:37,044
There is a walled garden up the road. We're going to take you there and cut your throat.

504
00:54:37,069 --> 00:54:40,056
Not across. In the middle, like a hole.

505
00:54:40,195 --> 00:54:44,183
Then we take your balls and we stuff them in the cut to block the windpipe.

506
00:54:45,139 --> 00:54:45,988
Complex!

507
00:54:46,013 --> 00:54:48,993
It's very gratifying to watch a man you don't like...

508
00:54:49,251 --> 00:54:53,231
try to pull his own balls out of his throat before he chokes.

509
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:56,261
Is this how you treat all your guests? - We're finished.

510
00:55:00,335 --> 00:55:02,710
Do you like opera?

511
00:55:08,241 --> 00:55:11,403
What? - Not here.

512
00:55:14,304 --> 00:55:16,506
You sail? - Iâ€˜ve messed around on boats.

513
00:55:16,531 --> 00:55:21,523
Be on the dock at 8 ready to do more than mess around. â€“ 8 a.m.

514
00:55:35,553 --> 00:55:39,524
Max missed too much school this year. I'm taking him back to England.

515
00:55:39,548 --> 00:55:41,537
School won't be okay with him missing so much. - Yes, they will.

516
00:55:41,561 --> 00:55:43,540
Can I finish?

517
00:55:43,564 --> 00:55:46,004
You want the trappings of a king.

518
00:55:46,029 --> 00:55:50,562
We both know You're a grubby little man playing power games with a wife that doesn't love you anymore.

519
00:55:51,569 --> 00:55:54,401
You seem...

520
00:55:54,426 --> 00:55:56,423
spirited today.

521
00:55:57,576 --> 00:56:00,564
Do I? - Yes, you do.

522
00:56:06,389 --> 00:56:08,380
Were you worried it had been destroyed?

523
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:13,027
Rest assured, instinct told me to remove it from the vault.

524
00:56:13,052 --> 00:56:15,063
I've always had instincts about the future.

525
00:56:17,204 --> 00:56:22,206
That's how I built this life you no longer value.

526
00:56:35,607 --> 00:56:38,608
Sailing or diving?

527
00:56:54,627 --> 00:56:56,728
Rising!

528
00:57:20,211 --> 00:57:22,223
What do you know about opera?

529
00:57:23,048 --> 00:57:28,051
In 2008 a remote Russian missile station was overwhelmed and held for a week.

530
00:57:28,671 --> 00:57:30,970
When the station was retaken...

531
00:57:30,995 --> 00:57:34,692
the 241 on one warhead was three quarters of a kilo lighter.

532
00:57:38,676 --> 00:57:40,655
The missing 241...

533
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,661
surfaced at the opera house siege in Kiev on the 14th.

534
00:57:43,685 --> 00:57:45,681
Coming about!

535
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,707
What do you propose?

536
00:58:06,706 --> 00:58:09,711
A partnership. - I wouldn't partner with you.

537
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:13,721
You can take care of yourself. You have no record.

538
00:58:14,203 --> 00:58:18,183
Someone in the arms trade with training. Knows how to cover his tracks.

539
00:58:18,382 --> 00:58:21,377
Not that shocking. For an intelligence agent.

540
00:58:21,724 --> 00:58:23,721
Right!

541
00:58:26,397 --> 00:58:28,999
Burn in hell, Andrei!

542
00:58:35,314 --> 00:58:39,223
You can't turn the boat like this! - You can if you have to!

543
00:59:06,227 --> 00:59:09,215
Why didn't you let him drown? - I need him.

544
00:59:09,767 --> 00:59:12,234
To sell guns? - I'm not who you think I am.

545
00:59:12,259 --> 00:59:15,260
Of that I know. He showed me the drawing.

546
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:20,759
I'm sorry. I had to get close to him. I don't know what you think your husband does.

547
00:59:20,783 --> 00:59:23,423
Oh, we both know he's an arms dealer.

548
00:59:23,448 --> 00:59:26,108
He's so much more. - What then?

549
00:59:26,133 --> 00:59:30,438
Andrei Sator holds all of our lives in his hands, not just yours.

550
00:59:38,038 --> 00:59:40,131
Mr. Sator wants to see you. - Okay.

551
00:59:41,086 --> 00:59:43,073
Now.

552
00:59:43,252 --> 00:59:45,960
Uh, he wants to see me without pants?

553
00:59:51,569 --> 00:59:55,572
Trust me. - Save it. I'm not falling for it twice.

554
00:59:57,659 --> 01:00:00,646
You have a better option?

555
01:00:02,013 --> 01:00:06,654
Whatever it takes to get what you want. Not a second thought for me or my son.

556
01:00:11,193 --> 01:00:13,835
What do you think he's going to do to me now?

557
01:00:24,847 --> 01:00:27,837
Try not to use it.

558
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,288
On anyone.

559
01:00:35,201 --> 01:00:37,205
Enough!

560
01:00:40,393 --> 01:00:43,391
See? A pulse of a man half my age.

561
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,412
Drink with me.

562
01:00:50,093 --> 01:00:52,080
It seems I now owe you my life.

563
01:00:52,748 --> 01:00:55,723
It was nothing. - My life is not nothing.

564
01:00:55,748 --> 01:00:58,445
And I don't like to be in debt.

565
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:02,481
Then pay me. No retribution against your wife.

566
01:01:05,778 --> 01:01:08,763
You think she released my harness?

567
01:01:09,561 --> 01:01:17,184
Hm. It was my own mistake. - Then help me steal the 241. I need resources.

568
01:01:17,209 --> 01:01:20,515
It's weapons grade plutonium. That means special handling. Containment facilities.

569
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:22,549
I know what it means.

570
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,003
You lecture me about radiation.

571
01:01:28,012 --> 01:01:29,992
Andrei Sator,

572
01:01:30,065 --> 01:01:34,062
digging plutonium from the rubble of my city as a teenager.

573
01:01:34,917 --> 01:01:36,919
Where?

574
01:01:38,688 --> 01:01:40,688
Stalsk 12.

575
01:01:42,424 --> 01:01:44,432
My home.

576
01:01:45,945 --> 01:01:51,218
One part of a warhead exploded at ground level, scattering the others.

577
01:01:52,137 --> 01:01:55,925
They needed people to find the plutonium.

578
01:01:56,711 --> 01:02:03,147
It became my first contract. Nobody else even bid. They thought it was a death sentence.

579
01:02:05,008 --> 01:02:06,031
But...

580
01:02:07,403 --> 01:02:10,399
one man's probability of death...

581
01:02:12,403 --> 01:02:17,368
is another man's possibility for a life.

582
01:02:19,062 --> 01:02:22,047
I staked my claim in the new Russia.

583
01:02:22,414 --> 01:02:26,414
Even now, my company is the only one to operate in the ruins.

584
01:02:27,415 --> 01:02:30,398
The 241 is being transported through Northern Europe...

585
01:02:30,422 --> 01:02:34,428
on its way to the long term nuclear storage depot in Trieste.

586
01:02:35,914 --> 01:02:37,922
I'm told you have resources in Tallinn.

587
01:02:42,455 --> 01:02:46,458
Stay with us tonight. I insist.

588
01:03:14,229 --> 01:03:17,238
What do you want? - We're going to talk about today.

589
01:03:18,745 --> 01:03:20,750
No, we're not. - No?

590
01:03:22,245 --> 01:03:24,217
We'll see.

591
01:03:24,241 --> 01:03:28,251
don't think for a second you can treat me like you treat your other women.

592
01:03:30,233 --> 01:03:32,233
And...

593
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:35,081
how do you imagine...

594
01:03:35,944 --> 01:03:39,930
I treat these other women, huh? Do you think I force them into conversation?

595
01:03:40,179 --> 01:03:43,860
You want to be quiet? Fine. You can bite down on that.

596
01:03:46,258 --> 01:03:50,251
Even a soul as blank and brittle as yours needs a response.

597
01:03:51,265 --> 01:03:55,234
Is fear and pain enough, Andrei? It's all I have to offer you.

598
01:03:55,259 --> 01:03:59,249
Well, that will have to do then. - Why don't you just let me go?

599
01:03:59,273 --> 01:04:01,275
Because...

600
01:04:03,277 --> 01:04:08,273
if I can't have you...

601
01:04:09,288 --> 01:04:12,279
no one else can.

602
01:04:13,289 --> 01:04:16,266
And if you touch me, I scream so loud he hears.

603
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:21,263
You think I'll let him interfere? - If you try to, you'd have to kill him.

604
01:04:21,287 --> 01:04:23,295
End of deal.

605
01:04:24,289 --> 01:04:26,292
So you leave me alone.

606
01:04:28,158 --> 01:04:29,717
Not now!

607
01:06:49,034 --> 01:06:53,039
98. Not bad for such exertion.

608
01:07:05,041 --> 01:07:07,038
He was at the window.

609
01:07:08,043 --> 01:07:10,054
I was curious.

610
01:07:10,752 --> 01:07:12,775
My property shouldn't concern you.

611
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:17,443
Who are you? How do you come by your information about the opera?

612
01:07:17,468 --> 01:07:22,033
You wouldn't do business with someone who wasn't savvy enough to be recruited.

613
01:07:22,057 --> 01:07:25,047
Now the CIA provides two-thirds of the market for fissile material.

614
01:07:25,071 --> 01:07:28,060
They're usually buying, not selling.

615
01:07:29,063 --> 01:07:33,055
But we do live in a twilight world. - Is that Whitman? Pretty.

616
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:36,075
Next one is a bullet in the brain.

617
01:07:37,763 --> 01:07:39,751
No balls in my throat?

618
01:07:40,078 --> 01:07:43,047
There will be no time for such things...

619
01:07:43,071 --> 01:07:44,065
in Tallinn.

620
01:07:44,089 --> 01:07:48,064
You make your way there. I want Volkov on your team.

621
01:07:48,088 --> 01:07:50,089
No.

622
01:07:52,098 --> 01:07:57,636
I spring the material. You pay me off. And your wife does the exchange.

623
01:07:57,661 --> 01:08:01,083
I never involve her in my business. - Yeah, That's why I trust her.

624
01:08:01,107 --> 01:08:03,085
Put him ashore.

625
01:08:03,109 --> 01:08:05,713
How do I contact you? - You don't.

626
01:08:05,738 --> 01:08:09,100
How do you advance me the funds?

627
01:08:11,114 --> 01:08:14,117
Handle the plutonium better than that.

628
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:27,907
What did you find on the gold? - No franks, no mold marks. Nothing.

629
01:08:27,932 --> 01:08:30,109
How? - Dead drops.

630
01:08:30,133 --> 01:08:33,115
He buries his time capsule, transmits the location,

631
01:08:33,139 --> 01:08:37,108
then digs it up to collect the inverted materials they send him.

632
01:08:37,132 --> 01:08:39,997
Seemingly instantaneous. Where does he bury it?

633
01:08:40,022 --> 01:08:42,997
Some place that won't be discovered for centuries.

634
01:08:43,022 --> 01:08:45,124
What did the soil samples show?

635
01:08:45,148 --> 01:08:48,941
Northern Europe. Asia. Radioactive.

636
01:08:48,966 --> 01:08:52,158
Everything salvaged from Oslo has been shipped here.

637
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:56,811
Why am I here? - I don't trust anyone else to assess the pieces.

638
01:08:57,943 --> 01:08:59,936
My convoy through downtown. What's the thinking?

639
01:09:00,295 --> 01:09:03,144
Crowded. Unpredictable traffic patterns.

640
01:09:03,168 --> 01:09:05,171
It's almost impossible to plan an ambush.

641
01:09:05,664 --> 01:09:09,423
You have a point. Is the convoy monitored from the air?

642
01:09:09,448 --> 01:09:13,151
Tracked by GPS. One wrong turn, in come the cavalry.

643
01:09:13,175 --> 01:09:17,150
We need big guns. Guns that'll make the point without being fired.

644
01:09:17,174 --> 01:09:21,378
A fast car that doesn't look fast. Four heavy vehicles. All different.

645
01:09:21,403 --> 01:09:25,167
A bus, a coach, an eighteen wheeler. One of them has to be a fire truck.

646
01:09:25,191 --> 01:09:28,771
Most of all, we have to set this up with nothing in the record.

647
01:09:28,796 --> 01:09:30,994
Nothing electronic. Nothing paper.

648
01:09:31,019 --> 01:09:35,033
I don't want Sator ambushing us once we spring the material.

649
01:09:35,058 --> 01:09:38,189
His ignorance is our only protection.

650
01:10:14,984 --> 01:10:19,977
You see, Kat. Some of my favorites.

651
01:10:20,991 --> 01:10:26,173
Singed, but ah, salvageable, wouldn't you say?

652
01:10:26,198 --> 01:10:28,967
It's not my area of expertise. - Ah That's right,

653
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:32,005
you would never have anything to do with such things.

654
01:10:33,002 --> 01:10:35,972
But this is where our worlds collide.

655
01:10:35,996 --> 01:10:40,016
What is this, Andrei? - You know perfectly well what it is, Kat.

656
01:10:43,036 --> 01:10:45,016
The filthy business...

657
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,775
that put those clothes on your back and our boy in his school.

658
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,052
That you thought you could negotiate your way around.

659
01:10:52,045 --> 01:10:54,047
The convoy in ten minutes.

660
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:03,699
Time to go. - I'm not going anywhere with you.

661
01:11:03,723 --> 01:11:05,715
Look at me!

662
01:11:05,739 --> 01:11:08,702
And understand...

663
01:11:08,726 --> 01:11:11,606
you don't negotiate with a tiger.

664
01:11:11,631 --> 01:11:15,311
You admire a tiger until it turns on you...

665
01:11:15,462 --> 01:11:20,087
and you feel It's true fucking nature!

666
01:11:20,453 --> 01:11:22,437
don't.

667
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:24,740
You stay right there.

668
01:11:28,381 --> 01:11:31,369
Green, two minutes.

669
01:11:54,572 --> 01:11:57,402
You're not going to kill me. - I already tried.

670
01:11:57,427 --> 01:12:01,134
You pushed me off a boat, you are not going to shoot me in cold blood.

671
01:12:01,159 --> 01:12:03,165
My blood's not cold, Andrei.

672
01:12:03,776 --> 01:12:06,782
No, but you're not angry enough.

673
01:12:08,583 --> 01:12:12,572
Because anger scars over into despair.

674
01:12:13,795 --> 01:12:15,802
I look in your eyes...

675
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:19,471
I see despair.

676
01:12:22,808 --> 01:12:26,243
Vengeful bitch! Living off me.

677
01:12:26,268 --> 01:12:30,252
Thinking that you're better! Enough!

678
01:12:53,829 --> 01:12:56,545
Tell me everything as it happens.

679
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:00,414
Seal me this side.

680
01:13:17,857 --> 01:13:21,861
Yellow, 60 seconds. - 60, check.

681
01:13:36,733 --> 01:13:40,747
Blue, 45 seconds. - Blue, 45, check.

682
01:13:57,694 --> 01:14:00,656
Okay, Red. We're coming to you.

683
01:14:09,332 --> 01:14:11,324
The three trucks are in place.

684
01:14:15,168 --> 01:14:18,162
Watch everything. Give me all the details.

685
01:15:03,213 --> 01:15:05,211
All right, box set?

686
01:15:10,223 --> 01:15:12,225
Five.

687
01:15:13,223 --> 01:15:14,234
Four.

688
01:15:15,234 --> 01:15:19,189
Three, Two.

689
01:15:20,996 --> 01:15:21,997
One.

690
01:15:44,261 --> 01:15:45,263
Now, Yellow!

691
01:15:49,259 --> 01:15:53,271
We have a problem! - We need reinforcement! Shit!

692
01:16:04,821 --> 01:16:12,023
The radio is down. - Are they still in motion? Yep. - Okay.

693
01:17:59,933 --> 01:18:01,935
Check the radio chatter.

694
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:22,800
I've seen samples of encapsulation in every weapons class. This is not one of them.

695
01:18:22,825 --> 01:18:24,834
That's what he's after.

696
01:18:27,966 --> 01:18:30,943
I can't understand this. - You said you spoke Estonian.

697
01:18:30,967 --> 01:18:34,966
It's not Estonian. It's backwards.

698
01:18:38,977 --> 01:18:40,978
What the hell is that?

699
01:18:55,515 --> 01:18:56,602
Go, go, go, go!

700
01:19:43,049 --> 01:19:45,049
don't give it to him.

701
01:19:46,029 --> 01:19:49,068
This isn't plutonium. - It's worse than that, goddammit!

702
01:20:06,669 --> 01:20:07,833
Sorry.

703
01:20:24,079 --> 01:20:25,891
He's getting away.

704
01:20:27,082 --> 01:20:31,076
He left her in the car! Go after her! Go, go, go, go, go!

705
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,106
Pull up along side.

706
01:21:01,117 --> 01:21:03,127
Come on, come on. Closer!

707
01:21:07,128 --> 01:21:09,117
Keep it steady! Keep it steady!

708
01:21:10,487 --> 01:21:11,973
Hurry up!

709
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:15,563
Come on!

710
01:21:50,376 --> 01:21:56,176
Sit tight. I'm calling in the cavalry. - What cavalry?

711
01:23:00,247 --> 01:23:04,228
If you are not telling the truth, she dies.

712
01:23:05,247 --> 01:23:10,238
I don't know what you're talking about. - You left it in the car, not the firetruck, right?

713
01:23:10,782 --> 01:23:15,236
Who told you that? - Just tell me if it's in the BMW.

714
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:19,248
I don't know. - Tell me or I'll shoot her again.

715
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:21,855
Leave her alone! - Kill him!

716
01:23:22,269 --> 01:23:24,267
I do not have time to negotiate.

717
01:23:29,796 --> 01:23:30,844
Listen to me. - Three.

718
01:23:30,869 --> 01:23:34,086
I can help you. - Two.

719
01:23:34,423 --> 01:23:37,264
don't! - One.

720
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:42,953
Next one's a bullet through the head.

721
01:23:42,977 --> 01:23:44,947
No. - One.

722
01:23:44,971 --> 01:23:46,396
Two, Three.

723
01:23:46,576 --> 01:23:48,555
Okay! Okay.

724
01:23:48,657 --> 01:23:53,654
The car. The BMW. I left it in the BMW. - We're going to check this is real.

725
01:23:55,988 --> 01:23:57,990
It's in the glove box!

726
01:23:58,425 --> 01:23:59,444
Where did you leave it?

727
01:24:00,446 --> 01:24:02,451
The car or fire truck? Which one?

728
01:24:03,432 --> 01:24:06,074
Which vehicle did you leave it in? I need to know before I go out there.

729
01:24:06,099 --> 01:24:09,103
I already told you. - I believe you.

730
01:24:09,134 --> 01:24:12,137
You wanted her here, I hope You'll be happy...

731
01:24:23,859 --> 01:24:27,824
Clear! - Wheeler, go check the other side.

732
01:24:27,848 --> 01:24:28,835
You two!

733
01:24:28,859 --> 01:24:31,693
Where did he go? - The past.

734
01:24:53,892 --> 01:24:57,893
It's in the glove box! - We're going to check this is real.

735
01:25:00,898 --> 01:25:03,870
Three, two, one. - Okay! Okay.

736
01:25:03,895 --> 01:25:05,903
Next one's a bullet through the head.

737
01:25:06,897 --> 01:25:08,905
No. No! - One.

738
01:25:09,485 --> 01:25:11,919
Listen to me. - Two, Three.

739
01:25:12,904 --> 01:25:15,890
I can help you. - I don't have time to negotiate.

740
01:25:15,914 --> 01:25:18,888
Tell me or I'll shoot her again.

741
01:25:18,912 --> 01:25:21,885
Leave her alone! - Tell me now, is it really in the BMW?

742
01:25:21,909 --> 01:25:22,893
I don't know.

743
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:26,922
You left it in the car, not the firetruck, right? - Who told you that?

744
01:25:27,911 --> 01:25:31,923
If you are not telling the truth, she dies. - I don't know what you're talking about.

745
01:25:44,014 --> 01:25:48,022
Medic! - What's her status?

746
01:25:48,629 --> 01:25:50,712
Bring her by this side.

747
01:25:51,394 --> 01:25:54,017
Is she shot with an inverted round?

748
01:25:58,883 --> 01:26:01,392
This is Ives. He's one of us.

749
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:06,384
"Us"? Who are these guys? - Priya's, ours.

750
01:26:06,408 --> 01:26:09,994
How did Sator know about the ambush? - It's posterity.

751
01:26:10,019 --> 01:26:12,052
An ambush in the middle of the street can't stay out of the records.

752
01:26:12,077 --> 01:26:16,748
Bullshit! He knew every move we made! Every one of them! Somebody talked! Who was it?

753
01:26:16,773 --> 01:26:18,402
Was it you? - No. No.

754
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:23,853
At every stage, you've known too much. I'm going to ask you again.

755
01:26:24,874 --> 01:26:26,876
Did you talk?

756
01:26:28,413 --> 01:26:32,417
Nobody talked. We're running a temporal pincer movement.

757
01:26:32,442 --> 01:26:38,414
A what? - A pincer movement. But not in space. In time.

758
01:26:38,439 --> 01:26:41,370
Half his team moves forward through the event.

759
01:26:41,395 --> 01:26:43,919
He monitors them, and then attacks at the end moving backwards.

760
01:26:43,944 --> 01:26:47,936
Knowing everything. - Except for where I stashed the plutonium.

761
01:26:47,961 --> 01:26:51,287
Which isn't really plutonium, is it? - I told you it is what he was after.

762
01:26:51,312 --> 01:26:53,449
And you just told him where it was.

763
01:26:54,447 --> 01:26:57,433
I lied.

764
01:26:57,458 --> 01:26:59,827
Jesus, you lied about it?

765
01:26:59,852 --> 01:27:04,179
He couldn't verify inside the room. He'd have shot her anyway.

766
01:27:04,204 --> 01:27:07,071
Lying is standard operating procedure.

767
01:27:07,096 --> 01:27:08,861
It has spread too far. - Meaning what?

768
01:27:08,886 --> 01:27:12,208
She's gonna die. - Standard operating procedure.

769
01:27:12,233 --> 01:27:14,297
can't, can't you help her, can't you do something?

770
01:27:14,322 --> 01:27:17,454
Can you stabilize the inverse radiation by inverting the patient?

771
01:27:17,479 --> 01:27:19,184
It takes days. â€“ Lets go!

772
01:27:19,209 --> 01:27:22,778
We took control of this machine minutes ago. Before that it was Sator's.

773
01:27:22,803 --> 01:27:26,529
How long is she going to live on this side? - Three hours, tops.

774
01:27:26,554 --> 01:27:30,628
I'm taking her through. I'm not going to let her die. I'll take my chances.

775
01:27:30,653 --> 01:27:33,355
There's no way of bringing you back.

776
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:36,393
We find another machine. - A week ago? Where?

777
01:27:37,925 --> 01:27:42,268
Oslo. - That facility is inside an airport security perimeter.

778
01:27:42,293 --> 01:27:46,035
It's impregnable. - Mmm, it wasn't last week.

779
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:49,910
We're going in. You might as well help us.

780
01:27:49,935 --> 01:27:52,877
This is a proving window. As you approach the Turnstile,

781
01:27:52,902 --> 01:27:56,101
if you don't see yourself in the proving window, do not enter the machine.

782
01:27:56,126 --> 01:27:59,495
Why not? - If you don't see yourself reverse exit the machine, then you ain't getting out.

783
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,546
Is that gonna work? - Yeah.

784
01:28:02,571 --> 01:28:06,396
See for yourself. There's your answer. Let's go.

785
01:28:30,556 --> 01:28:34,123
She's stabilizing. I clean and closed, but the rest needs time.

786
01:28:34,148 --> 01:28:38,146
How long does she need? Four, five days. A week for sure.

787
01:28:39,074 --> 01:28:43,747
Neil, find a way to get us to Oslo. I'm going back out there.

788
01:28:43,772 --> 01:28:44,854
To do what?

789
01:28:44,879 --> 01:28:47,973
To stop Sator from getting away with whatever it is I just gave him.

790
01:28:47,998 --> 01:28:51,144
You didn't. You lied about where it was. Wait.

791
01:28:51,573 --> 01:28:54,942
You're going out there for her. - He threatened to kill her in the past.

792
01:28:54,967 --> 01:28:59,563
If he does, what happens to her here? - That's unknowable.

793
01:28:59,587 --> 01:29:02,310
If You're there to make change, You're not here to observe its effect.

794
01:29:02,335 --> 01:29:05,569
But what do you believe? - What's happened happened.

795
01:29:05,593 --> 01:29:08,570
We need to save her, here and now.

796
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:11,956
If you go back out there, you might hand him exactly what he's after.

797
01:29:12,591 --> 01:29:14,613
Don't let them take her back through there.

798
01:29:15,486 --> 01:29:16,504
We can't stay here.

799
01:29:17,616 --> 01:29:23,549
We don't have a lot of time. So why don't you find us a nice, cozy shipping container...

800
01:29:23,574 --> 01:29:25,761
that's just come of a ship from Oslo.

801
01:29:25,786 --> 01:29:30,000
This is cowboy shit. You have no idea what You're getting yourself into if you go through that door.

802
01:29:30,025 --> 01:29:33,831
Well, I'm going. So any tips would be welcome. - Wheeler, brief him.

803
01:29:33,856 --> 01:29:38,596
You'll need your own air. Regular air won't pass through the membranes of inverted lungs.

804
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:41,455
Number one rule, don't come in contact

805
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:42,598
with your forward self.

806
01:29:42,623 --> 01:29:45,448
That's the whole point of these barriers and protective suits.

807
01:29:45,473 --> 01:29:49,111
We don't have time. - Well, if your particles come into contactâ€¦

808
01:29:49,136 --> 01:29:51,495
What? - Annihilation.

809
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,405
That would be bad, right?

810
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:59,616
When you exit the airlock, take a moment to orient yourself. Things will feel strange.

811
01:29:59,641 --> 01:30:01,622
When you run, the wind will be at your back.

812
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:04,057
If you encounter fire, ice will form on your

813
01:30:04,058 --> 01:30:06,628
clothes as the transfer of heat is reversed.

814
01:30:06,652 --> 01:30:11,634
Gravity will feel normal, but be reversed for the world around you.

815
01:30:11,658 --> 01:30:15,638
You may experience distortions in your vision and hearing. This is normal.

816
01:30:15,662 --> 01:30:17,636
Can I drive a car? - Cowboy shit.

817
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:21,639
I can't vouch for the handling. Friction and wind resistance are reversed.

818
01:30:21,663 --> 01:30:24,087
You are inverted. The world is not.

819
01:30:24,112 --> 01:30:27,460
Was the transponder on the case? - We've tossed that case.

820
01:30:27,666 --> 01:30:31,676
I'm moving backwards. That's the ball I have to follow. Give me the reader.

821
01:30:38,496 --> 01:30:40,212
Are you ready?

822
01:33:31,343 --> 01:33:34,331
The material is not in the case.

823
01:33:34,558 --> 01:33:39,834
Get the other sections of the algorithm to the hypocenter. He was lying.

824
01:33:39,859 --> 01:33:43,615
It wasn't in the BMW. - So where is it?

825
01:34:28,910 --> 01:34:32,927
I saw the hand-off. You made me shoot her for nothing.

826
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:38,259
But you did get my pulse above 130. No one has done that before.

827
01:34:38,284 --> 01:34:40,919
Not even my wife.

828
01:35:09,471 --> 01:35:12,939
You left Ives and his team a hell of a clean-up.

829
01:35:12,963 --> 01:35:14,967
Heat transfer was reversed.

830
01:35:15,963 --> 01:35:19,968
You might be the first case of hypothermia from a gasoline explosion in history.

831
01:35:20,966 --> 01:35:22,965
At this point nothing surprises.

832
01:35:23,982 --> 01:35:27,944
We're headed back to Oslo? - In a Rotas shipping container.

833
01:35:27,968 --> 01:35:29,951
He's got the material, Neil.

834
01:35:29,975 --> 01:35:31,967
I handed it to him on a plate.

835
01:35:31,991 --> 01:35:36,466
I warned you. - What's happened happened. I get it now.

836
01:35:36,491 --> 01:35:39,974
But It's hard to take things on trust from people speaking half-truths.

837
01:35:39,998 --> 01:35:44,413
That's not fair. - You were a part of this before we met.

838
01:35:44,438 --> 01:35:46,444
Were you working for Priya? - No.

839
01:35:46,469 --> 01:35:51,009
Who recruited you, Neil? - It can't possibly do you any good to know that right now.

840
01:35:51,707 --> 01:35:56,014
When this is over, if We're still standing, and you still care,

841
01:35:56,682 --> 01:35:59,245
then you can hear my life story, okay?

842
01:36:01,999 --> 01:36:05,421
I'm sorry I involved you. - You need to tell me what's going on.

843
01:36:05,446 --> 01:36:09,311
Apparently Neil here knows more about it than I do. Good luck, pal.

844
01:36:09,336 --> 01:36:12,401
By telling Kat anything, We're compromising her in Priya's eyes.

845
01:36:12,426 --> 01:36:17,369
In Priya's eyes she's already compromised. She has the right to know why she might die.

846
01:36:17,394 --> 01:36:20,199
Am I gonna die? - Not if we have something to say about it.

847
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:23,029
And we do. - Who are you?

848
01:36:24,034 --> 01:36:28,025
Let's start with the simple stuff. Every law of physics...

849
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:36,020
The material is not in the case.

850
01:36:36,044 --> 01:36:40,042
Get the other sections of the algorithm to the hypocenter.

851
01:36:48,461 --> 01:36:50,463
Are you injured?

852
01:36:55,416 --> 01:36:57,418
What's the "algorithm", Neil?

853
01:36:59,087 --> 01:37:02,618
241 is one section of it. One out of nine.

854
01:37:03,845 --> 01:37:08,560
It's a formula, blended into physical form so it can't be copied or communicated.

855
01:37:08,913 --> 01:37:10,901
It's a black box with one function.

856
01:37:10,925 --> 01:37:13,375
Which is?

857
01:37:13,511 --> 01:37:16,372
Inversion. Not objects or people,

858
01:37:16,397 --> 01:37:19,107
but the world around us. - I don't understand.

859
01:37:19,132 --> 01:37:21,912
As they invert the entropy of more and more objects,

860
01:37:21,936 --> 01:37:25,911
the two directions of time are becoming more intertwined.

861
01:37:25,935 --> 01:37:29,440
Because the environment's entropy flows in our direction,

862
01:37:29,465 --> 01:37:33,616
we dominate. They're always swimming upstream. It's what saved your life.

863
01:37:33,641 --> 01:37:36,544
The inverted explosion was pushing against the environment.

864
01:37:36,569 --> 01:37:40,860
Pissing in the wind. - And the Algorithm, it'll change the direction of that wind.

865
01:37:40,885 --> 01:37:43,924
It can invert the entropy of the world.

866
01:37:43,949 --> 01:37:45,952
If that happens?

867
01:37:46,955 --> 01:37:50,933
Oh, end of play. - "End of play." Can you be a little more precise?

868
01:37:50,957 --> 01:37:52,885
Everyone and everything That's ever lived

869
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:55,629
destroyed instantly. Precise enough?

870
01:37:55,654 --> 01:37:57,963
Including my son.

871
01:38:00,595 --> 01:38:05,445
The more you sleep, the faster You'll heal.

872
01:38:18,995 --> 01:38:21,001
On a truck.

873
01:38:23,079 --> 01:38:24,475
Shouldn't be long now.

874
01:38:25,633 --> 01:38:29,897
I've been thinking. We're their ancestors.

875
01:38:29,922 --> 01:38:32,973
If they destroy us, won't that destroy them?

876
01:38:32,997 --> 01:38:36,010
Which brings us to the grandfather paradox. - The what?

877
01:38:37,009 --> 01:38:40,118
If you went back in time and killed your own grandfather,

878
01:38:40,143 --> 01:38:42,169
how could you have been born to commit the act?

879
01:38:42,194 --> 01:38:45,465
What's the answer? - There's no answer. It's a paradox.

880
01:38:45,490 --> 01:38:48,567
But in the future, those in power clearly believe they can...

881
01:38:48,592 --> 01:38:51,035
kick grandpa down the stairs, gouge his eyes out,

882
01:38:52,017 --> 01:38:54,998
slit his throat, without consequence.

883
01:38:55,022 --> 01:38:58,297
Could they be right? - Doesn't matter.

884
01:38:58,322 --> 01:39:02,037
They believe it. Because they're willing to destroy us.

885
01:39:04,035 --> 01:39:07,154
Can I go back to sleep now? - No. I thought of something else.

886
01:39:07,179 --> 01:39:10,432
Great. - This reversing the flow of time,

887
01:39:10,457 --> 01:39:15,044
doesn't us being here now mean it never happens? That we stop them?

888
01:39:15,713 --> 01:39:19,316
Well, optimistically, I'd say That's right. - Pessimistically?

889
01:39:19,341 --> 01:39:22,815
In a parallel world's theory we can't know the relationship between...

890
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:26,685
consciousness and multiple realities. Does your head hurt yet?

891
01:39:26,710 --> 01:39:28,714
Yes.

892
01:39:31,784 --> 01:39:33,785
Try sleep.

893
01:39:48,134 --> 01:39:50,132
Shit.

894
01:39:50,756 --> 01:39:52,758
They didn't take us inside.

895
01:39:54,155 --> 01:39:56,160
What do we do?

896
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:03,214
We use the breach. The chaos right after impact. Get ready.

897
01:40:05,339 --> 01:40:08,314
Has she healed enough?

898
01:40:08,339 --> 01:40:11,340
I don't know. I've never done this before.

899
01:40:11,933 --> 01:40:13,987
The fire crew's there.

900
01:40:14,012 --> 01:40:17,376
Take Kat to the breach. I take care of Sator's men and secure the vault.

901
01:40:17,401 --> 01:40:19,475
Then you bring her in.

902
01:40:20,710 --> 01:40:23,702
How is your arm? - Not good.

903
01:40:27,969 --> 01:40:30,999
We move as soon as we hear the engines.

904
01:40:34,098 --> 01:40:39,361
Hold on. - What? - You're bleeding. Let me take a look at it.

905
01:40:45,337 --> 01:40:47,330
Clear?

906
01:41:19,341 --> 01:41:21,349
Wait here. I'm going in.

907
01:43:18,223 --> 01:43:20,819
Come on! - Go, go, go!

908
01:43:51,323 --> 01:43:52,344
Now!

909
01:45:33,904 --> 01:45:37,102
You knew it was me coming out of that vault. Why didn't you say?

910
01:45:37,127 --> 01:45:40,230
That's a lot of explaining when someone's about to put a bullet in your own brain.

911
01:45:40,255 --> 01:45:44,312
But afterwards? - It's the same. I knew you'd be okay.

912
01:45:44,805 --> 01:45:49,362
What's happened happened. If I told you and you acted differently, who knows?

913
01:45:51,289 --> 01:45:53,792
The policy is to suppress.

914
01:45:53,923 --> 01:45:57,903
Whose policy? - Ours, my friend.

915
01:46:00,669 --> 01:46:04,669
We're the people saving the world from what might have been.

916
01:46:13,305 --> 01:46:15,037
Kat?

917
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:17,049
I'm here.

918
01:46:17,724 --> 01:46:20,723
There'll be quite a scar, but you'll be okay.

919
01:46:22,845 --> 01:46:25,465
You did it. - He did what?

920
01:46:26,188 --> 01:46:29,162
Andrei has the algorithm.

921
01:46:29,246 --> 01:46:31,259
You don't know where he is.

922
01:46:32,857 --> 01:46:35,071
Or when.

923
01:46:35,442 --> 01:46:37,839
Get Priya here to Oslo. - Why?

924
01:46:38,057 --> 01:46:40,837
If I don't do something, in two days she tells me about the 241.

925
01:46:40,904 --> 01:46:45,406
Nothing can change that. - We'll see. Just get her here.

926
01:46:48,093 --> 01:46:52,846
Hello, Priya. - What's going on? Where's Neil?

927
01:46:53,149 --> 01:46:57,094
Nursing Katherine Barton, who almost died because of you.

928
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:59,086
What did I do? - It's what you're going to do.

929
01:46:59,111 --> 01:47:04,450
In two days You're going to have me dangle plutonium-241 in front of the world's most dangerous arms dealer.

930
01:47:04,475 --> 01:47:08,387
Now I want to know why? - You had Sator get hold of 241?

931
01:47:08,412 --> 01:47:10,775
No, I let him get ahold of the Algorithm.

932
01:47:11,770 --> 01:47:14,311
So tell me about it, Priya?

933
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:18,977
It's.. it's unique. The scientist who built it took her own life...

934
01:47:19,002 --> 01:47:20,509
so she couldn't be forced to make another.

935
01:47:20,534 --> 01:47:22,758
A scientist in the future? - Generations from now.

936
01:47:22,782 --> 01:47:26,802
Why does she have to kill herself? - You're familiar with the Manhattan project?

937
01:47:27,783 --> 01:47:31,260
As they approached the first atomic test, Oppenheimer became concerned that...

938
01:47:31,285 --> 01:47:35,316
the detonation might produce a chain reaction engulfing the world.

939
01:47:35,341 --> 01:47:40,809
They went ahead anyway and got lucky. - Think of our scientist as her generation's Oppenheimer.

940
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:44,462
She devises a method for inverting the world.

941
01:47:44,487 --> 01:47:48,496
Becomes convinced that by destroying us, they're destroying themselves.

942
01:47:48,804 --> 01:47:50,519
The grandfather paradox.

943
01:47:50,804 --> 01:47:53,882
But unlike Oppenheimer, she rebels.

944
01:47:54,096 --> 01:47:58,802
Splitting the Algorithm into nine sections and hiding them the best place she can think of.

945
01:47:59,195 --> 01:48:01,299
The past. Here, now.

946
01:48:01,494 --> 01:48:05,246
There are nine nuclear powers. Nine bombs.

947
01:48:05,421 --> 01:48:09,059
Nine sets of the most closely guarded materials in the history of the world.

948
01:48:09,196 --> 01:48:13,248
The best hiding place possible. - Nuclear containment facilities.

949
01:48:13,947 --> 01:48:17,171
Sator's lifelong mission, financed and guided by the future,

950
01:48:17,207 --> 01:48:21,962
has been to find and reassemble the Algorithm. - Why did they choose him?

951
01:48:21,987 --> 01:48:26,250
Because he was at the right place at the right time. - The collapse of the Soviet Union.

952
01:48:26,275 --> 01:48:29,389
The most insecure moment in the history of nuclear weapons.

953
01:48:29,662 --> 01:48:33,541
How many sections does he have? - After the 241, all nine.

954
01:48:33,767 --> 01:48:38,632
Jesus Christ. And that's why you're going to do things differently this time.

955
01:48:39,727 --> 01:48:42,647
To change things? So Katherine won't get hurt?

956
01:48:42,672 --> 01:48:44,677
So Sator won't get the Algorithm.

957
01:48:46,857 --> 01:48:50,569
If that universe can exist, we don't live in it.

958
01:48:50,594 --> 01:48:55,508
Well, let's try. You're going to warn me? - No, I'm not.

959
01:48:56,201 --> 01:48:58,360
Ignorance is our ammunition.

960
01:48:58,780 --> 01:49:03,778
If you had known what the Algorithm was, would you have let it fallen into Sator's hands?

961
01:49:04,959 --> 01:49:06,880
You want Sator to get the last section.

962
01:49:06,905 --> 01:49:09,655
That is the only way he'll bring together the other eight.

963
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:13,081
I was supposed to steal it, then lose it.

964
01:49:13,106 --> 01:49:16,183
Mission accomplished. - You used me.

965
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:19,353
As you used Katherine.

966
01:49:19,734 --> 01:49:21,747
Standard operating procedure.

967
01:49:22,974 --> 01:49:25,784
You've done your part. - My part?

968
01:49:26,314 --> 01:49:28,538
I'm the protagonist of this operation.

969
01:49:28,851 --> 01:49:31,813
You are "a" protagonist.

970
01:49:32,194 --> 01:49:35,481
Did you think you were the only one capable of saving the world?

971
01:49:39,799 --> 01:49:46,962
No. But I am. Because I Haven't told you where he's assembling the Algorithm or when.

972
01:49:47,050 --> 01:49:50,079
You're about to. - No. I'm not.

973
01:49:50,104 --> 01:49:53,304
So deal us in. - "Us"?

974
01:49:53,798 --> 01:49:56,842
Why would you want to involve her again? - Because she can get close to him.

975
01:49:56,867 --> 01:49:59,603
Does he still trust her? - He thinks she's dead.

976
01:49:59,628 --> 01:50:03,035
But he used to. - You have started looking at the world in a new way.

977
01:50:03,142 --> 01:50:08,950
And now It's your turn. Assuming she makes it out alive. Whether or not you feel she knows too much.

978
01:50:08,975 --> 01:50:12,663
I can't. - If you don't have the authority, then talk to whoever's in charge of loose ends.

979
01:50:13,631 --> 01:50:18,174
I need your word that she and her son will be safe, Priya?

980
01:50:18,199 --> 01:50:21,190
What good is someone's word in our line of business?

981
01:50:26,692 --> 01:50:28,768
They'll be safe.

982
01:50:29,382 --> 01:50:33,393
There's a rally point offshore at Trondheim. Get yourselves up there.

983
01:50:33,418 --> 01:50:36,776
Ives has a team ready to invert. - You have a Turnstile?

984
01:50:36,801 --> 01:50:39,377
The exact technology We're trying to suppress.

985
01:50:39,402 --> 01:50:42,094
Fighting fire with fire is a treacherous business.

986
01:50:42,119 --> 01:50:45,474
But there are some people in the future who want to continue...

987
01:50:45,499 --> 01:50:48,157
the Algorithm's journey into the past.

988
01:50:48,757 --> 01:50:53,518
You see, Tenet wasn't founded in the past.

989
01:50:53,543 --> 01:50:57,014
It will be founded in the future.

990
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:26,419
Have you looked at the birds? - How are you feeling?

991
01:51:31,701 --> 01:51:35,147
Tell me You're gonna kill him. - I can't.

992
01:51:35,172 --> 01:51:38,172
Why not? I bet you've probably killed a lot of people.

993
01:51:38,197 --> 01:51:42,390
Not with a dead man's switch. - The fitness tracker he wears.

994
01:51:42,687 --> 01:51:45,600
He's obsessive about his health. - It'll be linked to a switch.

995
01:51:45,625 --> 01:51:49,595
Probably a simple email burst that reveals the location of the dead drop.

996
01:51:49,620 --> 01:51:51,597
Sets a fire, his heart stops.

997
01:51:51,622 --> 01:51:55,478
His death activates the Algorithm. If he dies, the world ends.

998
01:51:55,503 --> 01:51:57,378
No one dares kill him.

999
01:51:59,473 --> 01:52:01,897
No, you've missed the point.

1000
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:05,942
He's intending to end his life.

1001
01:52:08,054 --> 01:52:09,401
Why?

1002
01:52:10,350 --> 01:52:12,373
He's dying.

1003
01:52:13,038 --> 01:52:15,041
Inoperable pancreatic cancer.

1004
01:52:16,611 --> 01:52:18,513
And he's taking the world with him.

1005
01:52:18,658 --> 01:52:20,818
If he can't have it, no one can.

1006
01:52:20,929 --> 01:52:25,246
He gets to choose a time and place for the end of the world.

1007
01:52:25,271 --> 01:52:27,601
What moment? What does he choose?

1008
01:52:29,549 --> 01:52:32,802
You told me about a holiday where you let him feel loved.

1009
01:52:32,827 --> 01:52:35,518
Vietnam. - You said he vanished. What day?

1010
01:52:35,543 --> 01:52:38,942
Well, I went ashore with Max. And he threw off. But I don't know what day it was.

1011
01:52:38,967 --> 01:52:42,147
It was the 14th. Ten days ago. He was in Ukraine.

1012
01:52:42,172 --> 01:52:46,010
At the Kiev Opera siege. How do you know about that?

1013
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:49,677
The point is: he wasn't on his yacht. So that's his window.

1014
01:52:49,702 --> 01:52:52,526
To go back to that golden moment and have it be his last.

1015
01:52:52,660 --> 01:52:57,253
Everyone's last. We have to lift the Algorithm from the dead drop without Sator knowing.

1016
01:52:57,278 --> 01:52:59,486
If he believes It's there, he kills himself.

1017
01:52:59,511 --> 01:53:01,013
But not the rest of us.

1018
01:53:01,068 --> 01:53:04,101
Where's the dead drop? - Knowledge divided, my friend.

1019
01:53:04,126 --> 01:53:07,216
You're not going to tell me. - Ignorance is our ammunition.

1020
01:53:07,241 --> 01:53:09,843
But I need you back on that yacht, Kat. - Why?

1021
01:53:10,111 --> 01:53:15,022
You have to stop him killing himself until we know the Algorithm is out of the dead drop.

1022
01:53:15,303 --> 01:53:19,152
But if I'm caught, then my son sees. I don't want those moments to be full of anguish...

1023
01:53:19,177 --> 01:53:21,179
if they're going to be his last.

1024
01:53:22,031 --> 01:53:24,033
They're not.

1025
01:53:48,273 --> 01:53:52,839
Let's talk. We're working our way back to the 14th, but without knowing where the dead drop is...

1026
01:53:52,864 --> 01:53:55,467
there's only so much I can do to prepare.

1027
01:53:56,223 --> 01:53:58,513
Do you know what a hypocenter is?

1028
01:53:59,648 --> 01:54:01,915
It's ground zero for an underground nuclear test.

1029
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:06,987
Sir Michael Crosby told me about a detonation in Stalsk 12 on the 14th.

1030
01:54:07,222 --> 01:54:09,468
The dead drop is at the bottom of the hypocenter.

1031
01:54:09,493 --> 01:54:12,627
That explosion seals up the algorithm.

1032
01:54:12,652 --> 01:54:16,311
Then we better get it out of that hole before the bomb goes off then.

1033
01:54:18,334 --> 01:54:20,355
Line up. Move forward.

1034
01:54:23,877 --> 01:54:25,877
Next.

1035
01:54:28,349 --> 01:54:30,346
Line up.

1036
01:54:31,804 --> 01:54:32,826
Where's Neil?

1037
01:54:36,051 --> 01:54:38,841
He must have gone through already. - I didn't get to say goodbye.

1038
01:54:39,154 --> 01:54:43,856
This is goodbye, isn't it? - I'd like to say that you don't have to do this, Kat.

1039
01:54:43,881 --> 01:54:46,871
The worse thing Andrei ever did to me was that offer he made me...

1040
01:54:47,821 --> 01:54:50,824
Let me go if I agreed never to see my son again.

1041
01:54:52,021 --> 01:54:55,363
I shouted and swore.

1042
01:54:56,437 --> 01:54:58,861
But he'd seen it on my face, just for an instant.

1043
01:55:02,084 --> 01:55:06,359
I considered it. I don't know if I hate him more for what he's done,

1044
01:55:06,674 --> 01:55:09,686
or because he knows that about me.

1045
01:55:12,233 --> 01:55:15,242
A chance to help save my child. You can't know what that means to a mother.

1046
01:55:15,974 --> 01:55:18,739
No. - You've killed people you've hated before.

1047
01:55:19,183 --> 01:55:22,562
It's not usually personal. - Well, he's dying anyway. Maybe it doesn't even count.

1048
01:55:22,587 --> 01:55:27,395
It always counts, Kat. You're not there to kill him. You're the backstop.

1049
01:55:28,326 --> 01:55:31,074
If we don't lift that Algorithm, and he kills himself,

1050
01:55:31,099 --> 01:55:33,960
he takes us all with him.

1051
01:55:35,454 --> 01:55:38,070
You just keep up your end, okay?

1052
01:55:41,639 --> 01:55:45,843
Today's the 14th. Offshore of Siberia. Time for us to go.

1053
01:55:46,278 --> 01:55:49,369
You keep moving back another day, It'll give you some time to get back into Vietnam.

1054
01:55:49,394 --> 01:55:51,803
Who gets me on the yacht? - I've got somebody good lined up.

1055
01:55:51,828 --> 01:55:54,995
When It's over, and You're raising your boy, carry this.

1056
01:55:55,676 --> 01:55:58,132
There may be a time and place you feel threatened.

1057
01:55:58,157 --> 01:56:01,150
Hit "Talk", state your location, hang up.

1058
01:56:01,175 --> 01:56:05,171
Who gets the message? - Posterity.

1059
01:56:44,313 --> 01:56:49,315
Stalsk 12. Hidden from the world. A city where anything can happen.

1060
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:53,767
And today, ladies and gents, in ten minutes, it most assuredly does.

1061
01:56:53,792 --> 01:56:57,202
You've been divided into two teams for a temporal pincer movement.

1062
01:56:57,227 --> 01:57:01,484
We are Red Team, moving forward. In order to distinguish the teams, you'll wear these.

1063
01:57:01,509 --> 01:57:05,376
Our friends over there, Blue Team, led by Commander Wheeler, are inverted.

1064
01:57:05,401 --> 01:57:09,157
Why won't they let us see them? - Maybe we won't like what happened.

1065
01:57:09,182 --> 01:57:12,130
One hour from now they have this briefing.

1066
01:57:13,853 --> 01:57:17,321
Then we'll drop them on the ridge above the hypocenter...

1067
01:57:17,346 --> 01:57:19,659
as close in time to the detonation as possible.

1068
01:57:19,684 --> 01:57:23,496
Their objectives were clearance and clarification.

1069
01:57:23,799 --> 01:57:27,468
Now this briefing has the benefit of their experience.

1070
01:57:44,096 --> 01:57:49,076
Both teams have countdown watches. Ours counts down from ten, from landing,

1071
01:57:49,101 --> 01:57:52,401
to zero, to the explosion. Blue Team is reversed.

1072
01:57:52,426 --> 01:57:55,140
If you are not at the LZ at zero,

1073
01:57:55,165 --> 01:57:58,700
you are not leaving. You understand?

1074
01:57:59,221 --> 01:58:01,416
We drop in, clear LZ for the

1075
01:58:01,441 --> 01:58:04,480
Blue Team evacuation. Then we make our way into the city proper.

1076
01:58:04,505 --> 01:58:08,630
These buildings are abandoned, but we learned there is a Turnstile.

1077
01:58:08,831 --> 01:58:12,588
Expect a bitemporal response. - They'll have inverse ordinance?

1078
01:58:12,613 --> 01:58:18,104
Inverse, conventional, forward antagonists, inverted antagonists. They have it all.

1079
01:58:18,129 --> 01:58:22,509
On the other side of the city the ground rises to the ridge above the hypocenter.

1080
01:58:22,534 --> 01:58:27,658
A splinter unit will take this tunnel from the city to the floor of the hypocenter.

1081
01:58:27,683 --> 01:58:30,384
Blue Team located an entrance here.

1082
01:58:30,409 --> 01:58:32,607
The bomb is in this rock.

1083
01:58:32,632 --> 01:58:36,722
High above. Will trigger a collapse, sealing the cavern.

1084
01:58:36,747 --> 01:58:41,050
How do we defuse the bomb up there? - We don't. The explosion takes place as planned.

1085
01:58:41,075 --> 01:58:44,963
Now our job is to fail to defuse that bomb,

1086
01:58:44,988 --> 01:58:48,790
while the splinter unit achieves its task undetected.

1087
01:58:48,815 --> 01:58:51,584
Which is? - "Need to know" and you don't.

1088
01:58:51,609 --> 01:58:56,648
Any other stupid questions? Good. Let's go. Let's get ready.

1089
01:58:59,015 --> 01:59:02,184
I wanted to be in the first wave. - There is no first wave.

1090
01:59:02,209 --> 01:59:04,896
Red Team and Blue Team operate simultaneously.

1091
01:59:04,921 --> 01:59:08,934
Look, don't get on the chopper if you can't stop thinking in linear terms.

1092
01:59:08,959 --> 01:59:12,259
Now you want to be on the team that lifts the contents of the capsule?

1093
01:59:12,284 --> 01:59:15,628
Absolutely. - Yeah, That's us.

1094
01:59:16,398 --> 01:59:19,612
We're the splinter unit. - Just us?

1095
01:59:19,637 --> 01:59:23,183
No one who knows the contents of that capsule can leave the field.

1096
01:59:23,777 --> 01:59:26,766
I thought we'd manage ourselves.

1097
01:59:35,930 --> 01:59:39,530
It's 40 feet from the private deck to the water. Can you jump it?

1098
01:59:39,555 --> 01:59:41,179
I can dive it.

1099
01:59:41,204 --> 01:59:44,079
Until you see my signal, you don't let him die.

1100
02:00:19,505 --> 02:00:21,492
30 seconds!

1101
02:01:01,742 --> 02:01:03,952
Move, move, move!

1102
02:01:14,751 --> 02:01:17,757
We're coming in on a shock wave. Hang on people!

1103
02:01:27,082 --> 02:01:28,409
On your feet!

1104
02:01:56,436 --> 02:01:59,777
Ma'am, we thought you'd gone ashore. - Well, I snuck back to surprise Andrei.

1105
02:02:00,001 --> 02:02:01,991
The boss left.

1106
02:02:02,592 --> 02:02:04,597
Have Mr. Sator find me here.

1107
02:02:04,711 --> 02:02:07,031
And don't tell the others. I'll get the mess.

1108
02:03:14,877 --> 02:03:16,883
My! - Mine!

1109
02:03:31,453 --> 02:03:36,541
They told me you'd gone ashore. - They told me you'd flown off.

1110
02:03:36,566 --> 02:03:41,564
I came back to see you and Max. - Max is onshore with Anna.

1111
02:03:41,905 --> 02:03:46,777
We need time, just you and me, after what happened. - I was joking. It was a stupid joke.

1112
02:03:46,802 --> 02:03:48,298
You think I'm a terrible mother.

1113
02:03:48,323 --> 02:03:52,313
We both know my opinion of you is higher than yours of me.

1114
02:03:59,918 --> 02:04:02,927
I want things to be better, Andrei.

1115
02:04:17,756 --> 02:04:19,757
Take cover!

1116
02:04:23,399 --> 02:04:26,643
Get me a god damn AT4! Take him out! Now!

1117
02:04:26,952 --> 02:04:31,954
Get out from cover! Move! Move! Let's go! Move, move!

1118
02:05:42,197 --> 02:05:44,187
Wheeler!

1119
02:05:45,023 --> 02:05:47,033
Get out! - Come on!

1120
02:05:53,031 --> 02:05:54,049
Ives!

1121
02:05:55,812 --> 02:05:57,822
The splinter unit. Here.

1122
02:05:59,292 --> 02:06:01,845
You know it's going to be a beautiful sunset.

1123
02:06:01,870 --> 02:06:05,908
I'll get Max's boat back. We should share the moment with him.

1124
02:06:06,220 --> 02:06:08,222
I'll make you a drink.

1125
02:06:09,311 --> 02:06:11,313
Bring my son back to the boat.

1126
02:06:17,632 --> 02:06:21,622
We're running out of time. Let's go! - If they see us, it's all for nothing

1127
02:06:25,019 --> 02:06:27,808
We need a distraction. - Don't worry about it.

1128
02:06:31,494 --> 02:06:33,482
On my mark!

1129
02:06:35,715 --> 02:06:40,165
RPG, fire at the base! - That building on my mark!

1130
02:06:41,629 --> 02:06:45,626
Three! Two! - One! Fire!

1131
02:06:46,329 --> 02:06:48,323
Fire!

1132
02:07:02,427 --> 02:07:05,419
Move! Move!

1133
02:07:19,567 --> 02:07:22,562
No going back now. Come on.

1134
02:07:28,003 --> 02:07:32,012
What's that? - I borrowed it from the CIA.

1135
02:07:33,248 --> 02:07:36,829
What is it? - The way the world ends.

1136
02:07:36,854 --> 02:07:40,822
Not with a bang, but a whimper. - I don't understand.

1137
02:07:41,581 --> 02:07:44,249
When I take this, It's all over.

1138
02:07:44,472 --> 02:07:46,522
Then don't take it yet.

1139
02:07:49,383 --> 02:07:51,386
Why not?

1140
02:07:53,048 --> 02:07:56,680
Because we have the sunset coming, and a little Vodka left.

1141
02:07:57,752 --> 02:07:59,507
And Max will be here soon.

1142
02:07:59,978 --> 02:08:03,998
They said they thought it was you, not Anna, ashore with Max.

1143
02:08:06,528 --> 02:08:10,518
So long as you can tell the difference...

1144
02:08:12,379 --> 02:08:15,387
A moment's business, my love.

1145
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:31,903
Mahir, do you copy? Not clear! I repeat: Not clear!

1146
02:08:31,928 --> 02:08:36,459
Copy that. - I repeat: Not clear!

1147
02:09:02,644 --> 02:09:05,646
Neil! Neil!

1148
02:09:18,399 --> 02:09:19,417
Go!

1149
02:09:28,522 --> 02:09:31,504
We don't have anything big enough to blow this.

1150
02:09:37,541 --> 02:09:40,314
Try him. See if he's got a grenade.

1151
02:09:43,425 --> 02:09:45,942
Anything? - No, nothing.

1152
02:09:45,967 --> 02:09:47,968
Keep trying. Can you pick it?

1153
02:09:48,798 --> 02:09:52,033
I hope not. I paid a lot for that lock.

1154
02:09:52,185 --> 02:09:55,012
How do you like where my journey began and yours ends?

1155
02:09:55,037 --> 02:09:59,665
A little radioactive for my taste. - My fate was always bound up in radiation.

1156
02:10:00,868 --> 02:10:05,879
It worked where no one else would. I made a bargain with the devil.

1157
02:10:06,359 --> 02:10:10,104
Money for time. We sold our futures.

1158
02:10:10,129 --> 02:10:13,507
And now You're about to make the same mistake, for the entire world.

1159
02:10:13,532 --> 02:10:17,203
It wasn't a mistake. I made the bargain I got. What was yours?

1160
02:10:17,227 --> 02:10:21,105
You fight for a cause you barely understand,

1161
02:10:21,462 --> 02:10:24,842
with people you trust so little you've told them nothing.

1162
02:10:24,867 --> 02:10:27,111
When I die, the world dies with me.

1163
02:10:27,136 --> 02:10:30,325
And your knowledge dies with you, buried in a tomb,

1164
02:10:30,350 --> 02:10:32,572
like an anonymous Egyptian builder,

1165
02:10:32,597 --> 02:10:38,883
sealed in a pyramid to keep his secret. Your faith is blind. You're a fanatic.

1166
02:10:58,991 --> 02:11:01,231
What's more fanatical than trying to destroy the world?

1167
02:11:01,256 --> 02:11:03,750
I'm not. I'm creating a new one.

1168
02:11:04,370 --> 02:11:08,110
Somewhere, some time, a man in a crystaline tower throws a switch...

1169
02:11:08,590 --> 02:11:12,565
and Armageddon is both triggered and avoided.

1170
02:11:12,613 --> 02:11:15,982
Now time itself switches direction.

1171
02:11:16,007 --> 02:11:22,510
The same sunshine we basked in will warm the faces of our descendants generations to come.

1172
02:11:22,535 --> 02:11:24,262
How come they want to kill us?

1173
02:11:24,286 --> 02:11:28,127
Because their oceans rose and their rivers ran dry.

1174
02:11:28,152 --> 02:11:33,980
don't you see, they had no choice but to turn back. We're responsible.

1175
02:11:47,771 --> 02:11:50,865
Knowing this, do you still want me to stop?

1176
02:11:51,441 --> 02:11:55,488
Yes. Each generation looks after its own survival.

1177
02:11:55,513 --> 02:11:59,403
That's exactly what they're doing. - But not you. You're a traitor.

1178
02:11:59,428 --> 02:12:02,408
Bringing death to all because you have no life of your own left.

1179
02:12:02,776 --> 02:12:06,334
When I'm done, life continues. - Not your son's.

1180
02:12:06,535 --> 02:12:09,908
My greatest sin was to bring a son into a world I knew was ending.

1181
02:12:10,602 --> 02:12:12,621
Do you think God will forgive me?

1182
02:12:17,931 --> 02:12:18,935
Wait!

1183
02:12:20,108 --> 02:12:21,109
Wait!

1184
02:12:34,749 --> 02:12:36,750
Cover me!

1185
02:12:44,124 --> 02:12:46,122
Go! Go! Go!

1186
02:12:47,953 --> 02:12:52,878
You don't believe in God, or the future, or anything outside of your own experience.

1187
02:12:52,903 --> 02:12:57,330
The rest is belief, and I don't have it.

1188
02:12:58,118 --> 02:13:01,964
Without it, You're not human. You're just a madman.

1189
02:13:02,455 --> 02:13:06,453
Or a God, of sorts. - Like I said...

1190
02:13:09,898 --> 02:13:13,736
don't do it. Jesus! - Our time is up.

1191
02:13:19,919 --> 02:13:22,038
I'll give your love to my wife.

1192
02:13:22,600 --> 02:13:24,792
You're forgetting, I Haven't met her yet.

1193
02:13:25,088 --> 02:13:28,065
That's right. After you meet her, she dies.

1194
02:13:28,090 --> 02:13:31,080
I'll just give her my love instead.

1195
02:13:32,079 --> 02:13:33,093
Don't do it.

1196
02:13:34,245 --> 02:13:37,797
Volkov. Shoot him in the head.

1197
02:13:49,019 --> 02:13:51,417
Enough business, my love.

1198
02:13:55,166 --> 02:13:56,760
Ives!

1199
02:14:17,902 --> 02:14:20,896
You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?

1200
02:14:22,869 --> 02:14:25,207
But it sounds terribly important.

1201
02:14:27,470 --> 02:14:30,465
Where are you going? - Aren't you hot?

1202
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:50,219
What are you doing now? - Oh, I spilled sunscreen.

1203
02:14:50,556 --> 02:14:53,544
So what? - It's slippery.

1204
02:14:55,342 --> 02:14:57,705
Just come here.

1205
02:15:00,651 --> 02:15:03,648
Turn around. You'll like it.

1206
02:15:37,612 --> 02:15:41,262
I can't do this. I can't let you think you've won.

1207
02:15:41,287 --> 02:15:45,289
don't spoil this moment, Kat. - Not letting you go to your grave thinking We're coming with you.

1208
02:15:47,789 --> 02:15:49,366
You're dying alone, Andrei.

1209
02:15:49,391 --> 02:15:52,716
Come on, come on! - The gate is closed.

1210
02:15:53,438 --> 02:15:56,029
Mahir, do you copy? - Yeah.

1211
02:15:56,366 --> 02:15:58,850
Hold. I repeat: Hold.

1212
02:16:03,826 --> 02:16:05,474
Look in my eyes.

1213
02:16:06,511 --> 02:16:08,523
Which do you see?

1214
02:16:08,736 --> 02:16:11,646
Despair or anger?

1215
02:16:13,345 --> 02:16:18,340
I'm not the woman who can find love for you even though you scarred her on the inside.

1216
02:16:19,100 --> 02:16:23,036
I'm the vengeful bitch you scarred on the outside.

1217
02:16:25,908 --> 02:16:26,909
No!

1218
02:16:45,847 --> 02:16:47,528
Shit.

1219
02:16:47,553 --> 02:16:50,565
Ives, she killed him. Ives, do you copy? She killed him

1220
02:16:50,835 --> 02:16:53,312
She jumped the gun. She killed him.

1221
02:17:11,972 --> 02:17:13,986
Come on! Come on!

1222
02:17:18,679 --> 02:17:20,230
Up the ass with it.

1223
02:18:30,691 --> 02:18:33,086
Kat, you jumped the gun!

1224
02:18:33,499 --> 02:18:37,036
I couldn't do it! I couldn't let him die thinking he'd won.

1225
02:18:37,382 --> 02:18:42,090
I knew you'd find a way. Wait. You found a way. We're okay, right?

1226
02:18:42,115 --> 02:18:45,117
Yeah. I found a way. We're safe.

1227
02:19:06,215 --> 02:19:10,712
I thought you were inverted. - I changed gears halfway.

1228
02:19:10,959 --> 02:19:14,963
Looked like you needed help here. - Yeah. We needed help down there.

1229
02:19:16,275 --> 02:19:17,732
How did you get that lock open?

1230
02:19:18,280 --> 02:19:20,868
It wasn't me. didn't your team need you?

1231
02:19:21,685 --> 02:19:24,143
I'll get them on the next pass.

1232
02:19:24,289 --> 02:19:27,298
You right, Ives? - Once I've caught my breath.

1233
02:19:41,719 --> 02:19:44,707
No one who's seen this leaves the field.

1234
02:19:52,954 --> 02:19:53,967
Right.

1235
02:19:57,892 --> 02:19:59,875
We hide it.

1236
02:20:00,089 --> 02:20:02,074
We end our lives.

1237
02:20:02,422 --> 02:20:05,422
It's the only way to be sure.

1238
02:20:06,413 --> 02:20:08,388
As to when...

1239
02:20:08,658 --> 02:20:11,656
Maybe that's every man's decision to make for himself.

1240
02:20:12,153 --> 02:20:15,781
You're not going to kill us? - If I ever find you, I will.

1241
02:20:16,190 --> 02:20:17,795
You won't look too hard?

1242
02:20:18,599 --> 02:20:21,591
Yes, I will.

1243
02:20:23,515 --> 02:20:28,512
You're not going back to London to check on Kat, are you? - No. It's far too dangerous.

1244
02:20:29,072 --> 02:20:31,296
Even from afar?

1245
02:20:31,905 --> 02:20:33,919
Even from afar.

1246
02:20:35,627 --> 02:20:39,617
Ives! Wait.

1247
02:20:45,285 --> 02:20:47,294
Are you really going back in?

1248
02:20:49,764 --> 02:20:51,784
I'm the only one who can get that door open in time, right, Ives?

1249
02:20:52,921 --> 02:20:54,941
I don't know any locksmiths as good as you.

1250
02:20:56,896 --> 02:20:59,916
See? It's me in there again.

1251
02:21:01,142 --> 02:21:04,143
Weaving another past in the fabric of this mission.

1252
02:21:12,718 --> 02:21:13,739
Neil, wait!

1253
02:21:17,974 --> 02:21:22,019
We just saved the world. can't leave anything to chance.

1254
02:21:22,646 --> 02:21:25,171
But can we change things if we do it differently?

1255
02:21:25,426 --> 02:21:26,978
What's happened happened.

1256
02:21:27,995 --> 02:21:30,545
Which is an expression of faith in the mechanics of the world.

1257
02:21:31,688 --> 02:21:33,536
It's not an excuse to do nothing.

1258
02:21:34,141 --> 02:21:36,138
Fate? - Call it what you want.

1259
02:21:36,642 --> 02:21:39,645
What do you call it? - Reality.

1260
02:21:42,161 --> 02:21:44,167
Now, let me go.

1261
02:21:49,250 --> 02:21:51,571
Hey, you never did tell me who recruited you, Neil.

1262
02:21:51,986 --> 02:21:53,943
Haven't you guessed by now?

1263
02:21:54,825 --> 02:21:58,569
You did! Only not when you thought.

1264
02:21:59,016 --> 02:22:00,583
You have a future in the past.

1265
02:22:01,585 --> 02:22:04,586
Years ago for me. Years from now for you.

1266
02:22:05,598 --> 02:22:07,291
You've known me for years?

1267
02:22:08,953 --> 02:22:11,975
For me, I think It's the end of a beautiful friendship.

1268
02:22:12,767 --> 02:22:16,599
But for me, It's just the beginning. - We get up to some stuff.

1269
02:22:17,597 --> 02:22:20,587
You're going to love it. You'll see.

1270
02:22:20,935 --> 02:22:22,977
This whole operation is a temporal pincer.

1271
02:22:23,712 --> 02:22:24,730
Whose?

1272
02:22:26,366 --> 02:22:32,355
Yours! You're only halfway there. I'll see you at the beginning, friend.

1273
02:22:40,544 --> 02:22:43,260
We're the people saving the world from what might have been.

1274
02:22:43,861 --> 02:22:46,085
The world will never know what could have happened.

1275
02:22:47,568 --> 02:22:50,566
And even if they did, they wouldn't care.

1276
02:22:54,853 --> 02:22:59,911
Because no one cares about the bomb that didn't go off. Only the one that did.

1277
02:23:02,319 --> 02:23:05,311
Do it before the boy comes out.

1278
02:23:06,415 --> 02:23:09,639
That's your idea of mercy? You gave me your word.

1279
02:23:09,664 --> 02:23:12,646
And I told you then what it would be worth.

1280
02:23:13,082 --> 02:23:15,081
Here? Today?

1281
02:23:16,527 --> 02:23:19,521
How did you know?

1282
02:23:20,129 --> 02:23:22,833
Cannon Place, three o'clock. Probably nothing.

1283
02:23:23,047 --> 02:23:24,034
Posterity.

1284
02:23:24,159 --> 02:23:27,173
Cannon Place, three o'clock. Probably nothing.

1285
02:23:28,482 --> 02:23:31,666
I told you you'd have to start looking differently at the world.

1286
02:23:32,231 --> 02:23:35,309
I had to tie up the loose ends. - That was never your job.

1287
02:23:35,334 --> 02:23:37,666
Then whose was it? - Mine.

1288
02:23:37,690 --> 02:23:40,708
I realized I wasn't working for you. We've both been working for me.

1289
02:23:41,844 --> 02:23:43,467
I'm the protagonist.

1290
02:23:46,125 --> 02:23:49,124
Then you'd better tie up those loose ends.

1291
02:23:51,950 --> 02:23:53,957
Mission accomplished.

1292
02:23:55,623 --> 02:24:00,623
It's the bomb that didn't go off. The danger no one knew was real.
