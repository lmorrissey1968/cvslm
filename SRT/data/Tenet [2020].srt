54
00:01:24,105 --> 00:01:26,108
Wake up the Americans

55
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:29,009
Hey!

56
00:03:13,414 --> 00:03:15,408
We live in a twilight world.

57
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:19,084
We live in a twilight world.

58
00:03:19,387 --> 00:03:20,671
And there are no friends at dusk.

59
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:23,855
You've been made. This siege is a blind for them to vanish you.

60
00:03:29,097 --> 00:03:30,997
I established contact.

61
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:34,502
Bring you in or kill you, I have 2 minutes, make up your mind.

62
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,900
Where's the package? - Coat-check.

63
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,601
Stay!

64
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,317
Grab his!

65
00:04:25,962 --> 00:04:28,544
What are you doing? What are you doing?

66
00:04:30,384 --> 00:04:32,535
Who are you? Who are you?

67
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:38,044
No friends at dusk, huh? - You'll do. Get him to the rally point.

68
00:05:10,232 --> 00:05:12,742
Swap clothes! Ukrainians are expecting a passenger.

69
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:17,123
I've never seen an encapsulation like this. - We don't know how old it is, but It's the real deal.

70
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:20,826
Did you have an out? - A service tunnel to the sewer.

71
00:05:20,192 --> 00:05:24,184
Take this. Take him. Take his exit. I don't trust ours anymore. Can you defuse that?

72
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,319
It is centrally synchronized. Are there more? - They're covering their tracks.

73
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:29,176
Take out the audience? - It's just the cheap seats.

74
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,212
That's not our mission. - It's mine now.

75
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,226
Walk away.

76
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:04,231
You don't have to kill these people.

77
00:06:16,818 --> 00:06:19,084
That wasn't one of us. - I'll take the help.

78
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:23,255
Go, go, go, go, go!

79
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,896
It's not our guy!

80
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:56,693
A man can be trained to hold out for about 18 hours...

81
00:06:56,718 --> 00:06:59,789
so your colleagues will be cleared by seven.

82
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:09,779
He didn't last 18 minutes. He didn't have anything to hide.

83
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:11,812
You're smuggling a nobody.

84
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:16,809
That's risky.

85
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,795
Or were you counting on this? Death.

86
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,814
CIA issue.

87
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,838
Spare yourself. Once they clear.

88
00:07:50,371 --> 00:07:53,443
Almost seven, uh-oh.

89
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:00,864
It's running fast.

90
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:06,864
We have to put it back 1 hour.

91
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:28,880
Get it out!

92
00:08:51,743 --> 00:08:53,911
Welcome to the afterlife.

93
00:08:54,555 --> 00:08:57,962
You've been in a medically induced coma

94
00:08:57,963 --> 00:09:00,890
while we got you out of Ukraine and rebuilt your mouth.

95
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:06,905
The suicide pills were fake. Why?

96
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:09,927
A test. - A test?

97
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,937
They pulled my teeth out.

98
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:18,935
Did my team get clear?

99
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,946
No. Private Russians, we think.

100
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:25,948
Somebody talked.

101
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:31,947
Not you. You chose to die instead of giving up your colleagues.

102
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:44,937
We all believe we'd run into the burning building.

103
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:48,946
But until we feel that heat, we can never know.

104
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,953
You do.

105
00:09:56,271 --> 00:10:00,972
I resign. - You don't work for us, you're dead.

106
00:10:01,888 --> 00:10:06,977
Your duty transcends national interest. This is about survival.

107
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:10,989
Whose?

108
00:10:12,621 --> 00:10:13,994
Everyone's.

109
00:10:16,553 --> 00:10:19,975
There's a cold war, cold as ice.

110
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:23,498
To even know It's true nature is to lose.

111
00:10:23,592 --> 00:10:25,007
This is knowledge divided.

112
00:10:25,685 --> 00:10:28,986
All I have for you is a gesture

113
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:33,001
in combination with a word. "Tenet".

114
00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:37,018
Use it carefully.

115
00:10:37,349 --> 00:10:40,687
It'll open the right doors, but some of the wrong ones too.

116
00:10:40,754 --> 00:10:43,011
That's all they told you?

117
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:46,023
That test you passed?

118
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,031
Not everybody does.

119
00:13:01,165 --> 00:13:05,658
With a high-vis vest and a clipboard you can get almost anywhere.

120
00:13:05,714 --> 00:13:10,158
Almost. â€“ An obscure tenet.

121
00:13:18,268 --> 00:13:22,162
No small talk. Nothing that might reveal who we are or what we do.

122
00:13:22,186 --> 00:13:24,986
I thought I was here to find out what we do?

123
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:27,676
You're not here for "what", You're here for "how".

124
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:31,069
"What", is your department. That's not my business.

125
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:36,187
Well to do what I do, I need some idea of the threat we face.

126
00:13:38,602 --> 00:13:42,180
As I understand it, we are trying to prevent World War III.

127
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:44,207
Nuclear holocaust?

128
00:13:44,295 --> 00:13:45,315
No.

129
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:48,961
Something worse.

130
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:59,931
Aim it and pull the trigger.

131
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:04,206
It's empty. â€“ Aim it.

132
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:12,218
Check the magazine.

133
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,805
How?

134
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:25,553
One of these bullets is like us, traveling forwards through time.

135
00:14:25,694 --> 00:14:28,667
The other one's going backwards.

136
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:30,699
Can you tell which is which?

137
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:37,762
How about now? It's inverted. It's entropy runs backwards.

138
00:14:37,796 --> 00:14:40,623
So to our eyes, its movement is reversed.

139
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:44,021
We think It's a type of inverse radiation triggered by nuclear fission.

140
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:46,638
You didn't make it? - No, we don't know how yet.

141
00:14:46,663 --> 00:14:50,273
So where'd it come from? - Someone's manufacturing them in the future.

142
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:53,333
They're streaming back at us. Try it.

143
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:04,269
You have to have dropped it.

144
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:19,279
How can it move before I touch it? - From your point of view, you caught it.

145
00:15:19,303 --> 00:15:23,465
But from the bullet's point of view, you dropped it. â€“ But cause comes before effect.

146
00:15:23,581 --> 00:15:26,512
No. That's just the way we see time.

147
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:27,889
Well, what about free will?

148
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:31,093
That bullet wouldn't have moved if you hadn't put your hand there.

149
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:35,295
Either way we run the tape, you made it happen.

150
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:37,320
don't try to understand it.

151
00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:40,319
Feel it.

152
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:52,336
Instinct.

153
00:15:52,888 --> 00:15:53,901
Got it.

154
00:15:58,782 --> 00:16:00,784
Why does it feel so strange?

155
00:16:02,026 --> 00:16:04,011
You're not shooting the bullet.

156
00:16:04,348 --> 00:16:07,335
You're catching it.

157
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
Whoa

158
00:16:11,723 --> 00:16:14,705
I've seen this type of ammunition before. - In the field?

159
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:18,513
I was almost hit. - Then you were exceedingly lucky.

160
00:16:18,538 --> 00:16:22,555
An inverted bullet passing through your body would be devastating. Not pretty.

161
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,334
These look like today's. - They may have been made today and inverted years from now.

162
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:30,202
Where did you get them? - They came with the wall.

163
00:16:30,227 --> 00:16:33,050
I was assigned it, like all the material I'm studying here.

164
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:36,726
Do you have an analysis on the metals? - Sure. Why?

165
00:16:36,752 --> 00:16:40,753
The mixture of alloys can tell me where they have might have been made. Look...

166
00:16:41,987 --> 00:16:43,989
I'm not seeing Armageddon here.

167
00:16:46,136 --> 00:16:48,917
The bullet may not seem like much but It's a simple machine.

168
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,966
Lead bullet, brass casing, gunpowder.

169
00:16:52,526 --> 00:16:56,055
If they can invert that, we see no reason they couldn't invert pretty much anything.

170
00:16:56,244 --> 00:16:59,247
Even a nuclear weapon can only affect our future.

171
00:16:59,272 --> 00:17:02,829
An inverted weapon might be able to affect our past as well.

172
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:10,533
Now that we know what to look for, We're finding more and more inverted material.

173
00:17:10,557 --> 00:17:13,554
Remnants of complex objects.

174
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:19,451
What do you think We're seeing?

175
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,920
The detritus of a coming war.

176
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,526
Yup? We live in a twilight world.

177
00:17:44,572 --> 00:17:46,560
No friends at dusk. I was told you left the building.

178
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,571
Even the dead need allies. - Specifically?

179
00:17:50,073 --> 00:17:53,075
I need an assist in Mumbai. I need to get to Sanjay Singh.

180
00:17:53,392 --> 00:17:56,393
Singh? He never leaves his house, and his house is... his house.

181
00:17:56,868 --> 00:18:00,583
Yes it is. I'm looking right at it. - I'll see who's on deck.

182
00:18:01,076 --> 00:18:03,077
Bombay Yacht Club in two hours.

183
00:18:15,607 --> 00:18:19,624
Seems you need an introduction to a prominent Mumbai local on short notice.

184
00:18:21,608 --> 00:18:25,612
I'm Neil. - I need an audience with Sanjay Singh.

185
00:18:26,627 --> 00:18:30,612
That's not possible. - Ten minutes, tops.

186
00:18:30,636 --> 00:18:33,606
Time isn't the problem.

187
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,622
Getting out alive is the problem.

188
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:41,939
Would you take a child hostage? A woman?

189
00:18:42,314 --> 00:18:45,617
If I had to. I'm not looking to make much noise here.

190
00:18:45,831 --> 00:18:49,642
Yes? - Vodka tonic. And a diet Coke.

191
00:18:51,653 --> 00:18:53,635
What?

192
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:57,645
You never drink on the job. - You're well informed.

193
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,703
It pays to be in our profession. - Well I prefer soda water.

194
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:07,636
No, you don't.

195
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,641
How's your parachuting? - I broke an ankle during basic training.

196
00:19:11,665 --> 00:19:14,649
Singh's house isn't tall enough to parachute off of.

197
00:19:14,673 --> 00:19:18,650
It's bungee-jumpable. - I don't think "bungee-jumpable" is a word.

198
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:21,672
It may not be a word but it may be our only way out of that place.

199
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:24,681
Or into it for that matter.

200
00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:08,004
Hey!

201
00:21:09,405 --> 00:21:10,409
Stay back.

202
00:21:11,084 --> 00:21:14,965
I was almost taken out by a very unusual type of ammunition in Ukraine.

203
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,013
I want to know who supplied it.

204
00:21:17,584 --> 00:21:20,995
My name is Sanjay. And you are?

205
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:22,584
No chit-chat?

206
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:27,584
There's no one at the other end. No one who's going to help you anyway.

207
00:21:28,584 --> 00:21:30,050
don't let it get cold.

208
00:21:32,528 --> 00:21:34,220
Why should I know who supplied it?

209
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,861
The combination of metals is unique to India. If It's from India, It's from you.

210
00:21:38,886 --> 00:21:40,178
Fine assumption. - Deduction.

211
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,885
Deduction then. Look, my friend.

212
00:21:44,027 --> 00:21:49,044
Guns are never conducive to a productive negotiation. - I'm not the man they send to negotiate.

213
00:21:51,031 --> 00:21:56,034
Or the man they send to make deals. But I am the man people talk to.

214
00:21:57,638 --> 00:22:00,193
I can'tâ€¦ I can't tell you.

215
00:22:00,246 --> 00:22:04,060
You're an arms dealer, friend. This may be the easiest trigger I've ever had to pull.

216
00:22:04,787 --> 00:22:08,793
To say anything about a client would violate the tenets he lives by.

217
00:22:10,003 --> 00:22:14,829
If tenets are important to you, then you can tell me. Everything.

218
00:22:14,882 --> 00:22:17,995
Not while you have a gun to my husband's head.

219
00:22:18,067 --> 00:22:21,068
Sanjay, make a drink for our guest please.

220
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,076
Cheers. Priya.

221
00:22:25,081 --> 00:22:28,042
This is your operation.

222
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:31,049
A masculine front in a man's world has its uses.

223
00:22:31,073 --> 00:22:34,244
The dealer you are looking for is Andrei Sator. - The Russian oligarch.

224
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:38,800
Do you know him? - Not personally. Made his billions in gas.

225
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:42,069
Moved to London, said to be on the outs with Moscow.

226
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:47,075
Very good. Except the gas he made his billions from was actually plutonium.

227
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:51,077
None of which explains how or why you sold him inverted munitions?

228
00:22:51,101 --> 00:22:53,697
When I sold him the arms they were perfectly ordinary.

229
00:22:53,795 --> 00:22:56,083
So how did he get them inverted?

230
00:22:56,107 --> 00:23:01,109
We believe he's functioning as some sort of a broker between our time and the future.

231
00:23:02,584 --> 00:23:06,089
He can communicate with the future? - We all do, don't we.

232
00:23:06,113 --> 00:23:08,093
Emails, credit cards, texts.

233
00:23:08,117 --> 00:23:11,820
Anything that goes into the records speaks directly to the future.

234
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:18,110
The question is, can the future speak back? - And I'm supposed to find out?

235
00:23:18,134 --> 00:23:22,138
To get anywhere near Sator will take a fresh-faced protagonist.

236
00:23:22,697 --> 00:23:24,936
And you are fresh as a daisy.

237
00:23:25,127 --> 00:23:29,042
Get close, find out what he's receiving and how.

238
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:34,128
Is it safe to involve British Intelligence? - I have a contact, who's out of Sator's reach.

239
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:41,882
You must have had a plan for getting out.

240
00:23:42,658 --> 00:23:44,669
Not one I love.

241
00:24:07,615 --> 00:24:10,601
May I help you sir? Mr. Crosby's lunch.

242
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:14,610
I presume you mean â€œSirâ€� Michael Crosby's lunch. - Presumably.

243
00:24:14,634 --> 00:24:16,639
If You'll follow me.

244
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:24,169
I started without you. Hope you don't mind.

245
00:24:24,193 --> 00:24:26,176
I'll catch up.

246
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,715
Same for me, please. - I'll send the waiter.

247
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,183
No, just pass on the order.

248
00:24:31,207 --> 00:24:34,335
I gather you have an interest in a certain Russian national.

249
00:24:34,366 --> 00:24:37,178
Anglo-Russian, so I have to watch my step.

250
00:24:37,202 --> 00:24:41,815
Indeed, he's tapped into the intelligence services. I've warned them he's feeding them rubbish,

251
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,727
but they don't seem to care - Tell me about him.

252
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:49,764
I assume You're familiar with the Soviet-era secret cities.

253
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:54,198
Closed cities, not shown on maps, built around sensitive industries.

254
00:24:54,222 --> 00:24:59,206
Most of them have been opened up and renamed as regular towns. - Not the one Sator grew up in.

255
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:04,201
Stalsk 12. In the seventies it had a population of about 200,000.

256
00:25:04,225 --> 00:25:06,209
Thought to be abandoned. - Abandoned?

257
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:10,246
Had some kind of accident. After which it was used for underground tests.

258
00:25:10,388 --> 00:25:13,687
Two weeks ago, the same day as the Kiev Opera siege,

259
00:25:13,795 --> 00:25:19,213
we spotted a detonation in northern Siberia just where Stalsk 12 was.

260
00:25:19,237 --> 00:25:22,235
Sator emerged from this blackspot on the map...

261
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:27,264
with ambition and enough money to buy his way into the British establishment.

262
00:25:27,843 --> 00:25:31,828
Through his wife? - Katherine Barton. Eldest niece of Sir Fredrick Barton.

263
00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:34,239
She works at Shipley's. Met Sator at an auction.

264
00:25:34,264 --> 00:25:37,249
Happy marriage? - Practically estranged.

265
00:25:37,273 --> 00:25:39,879
Well, how do I get to Sator? - Through her of course.

266
00:25:39,967 --> 00:25:43,252
Well, you may have an inflated idea of my powers of seduction.

267
00:25:43,276 --> 00:25:45,256
Hardly.

268
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,282
We have an ace in the hole.

269
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,684
You're carrying a Goya in a Harrods bag?

270
00:25:52,709 --> 00:25:55,690
It's a fake by a Spaniard named Arepo.

271
00:25:55,778 --> 00:25:58,925
One of the two we confiscated from an embezzler in Bern.

272
00:25:58,962 --> 00:26:00,214
What happened to the other one?

273
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:03,092
It turned up at Shipley's. Authenticated by Katherine Barton.

274
00:26:03,427 --> 00:26:04,921
Put on auction,

275
00:26:05,028 --> 00:26:08,283
and who do you think bought it? - Her husband?

276
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:13,284
Does she know it's a forgery? - Oh, it's hard to say.

277
00:26:13,308 --> 00:26:19,295
Rumor has it, that she and Arepo were close. - A-ah

278
00:26:19,674 --> 00:26:21,658
Look, no offence,

279
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:25,202
but in this world where someone is claiming to be a billionaire,

280
00:26:27,071 --> 00:26:29,056
Brooks Brothers won't cut it.

281
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:34,301
I'm assuming I'm on a budget. - Save the world, then we'll balance the books.

282
00:26:34,325 --> 00:26:37,305
Can I recommend a tailor? - I'll manage.

283
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,479
You British don't have a monopoly on snobbery you know.

284
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:43,473
- Well, not a monopoly. More of a controlling interest.

285
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:47,505
Can you box that up for me? - Certainly not.

286
00:26:48,584 --> 00:26:50,584
Goodbye, Sir Michael.

287
00:27:22,584 --> 00:27:25,366
How can I help sir?

288
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:30,281
Sorry, I wasn't notified of any appointments, Mr...?

289
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:33,360
Goya.

290
00:27:33,384 --> 00:27:37,380
Mr. Goya? - No, I'm told You're the person to see about Goya.

291
00:27:39,584 --> 00:27:40,607
That's extraordinary.

292
00:27:45,926 --> 00:27:48,897
What's it worth?

293
00:27:48,921 --> 00:27:50,934
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

294
00:27:52,036 --> 00:27:56,022
Lots of work to do before any kind of valuation.

295
00:27:56,358 --> 00:28:00,010
Provenance, microscopic examination, X-raysâ€¦

296
00:28:00,123 --> 00:28:02,127
But what does your heart tell you?

297
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:10,422
So where did you say you acquired this drawing? - Tomas Arepo.

298
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:17,173
I bought my Goya for cents on the dollar from an irate Swiss banker.

299
00:28:17,433 --> 00:28:20,411
Traced it back to Arepo and then realized I had scored a bargain,

300
00:28:20,435 --> 00:28:23,318
when he told me who paid top dollar for another one of his pictures.

301
00:28:23,343 --> 00:28:25,350
Your husband. - Where's your bargain?

302
00:28:25,816 --> 00:28:28,607
Your drawing's an obvious fake. - My drawing's a very good fake.

303
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:32,736
You know that better than anyone. The information's the bargain.

304
00:28:33,444 --> 00:28:35,948
The information that I helped defraud my own husband?

305
00:28:35,973 --> 00:28:38,956
He and I are in related businesses, but he's a very hard man to meet.

306
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:42,156
If you and I were to make an arrangement... - An arrangement?

307
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:45,016
You mean blackmail? Don't be afraid of the word.

308
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:49,021
My husband isn't. I'm sorry to tell you he got there first.

309
00:28:49,046 --> 00:28:51,025
He knows, and he's never done anything about it?

310
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,763
Why would he? - He paid 9 million dollars for it.

311
00:28:53,788 --> 00:28:57,788
Barely cover the cost for the holiday he just forced us on. - Where'd you go? Mars?

312
00:28:58,994 --> 00:29:01,990
Vietnam on our yacht. His yacht.

313
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,303
You've got the suit, the shoes, the watch,

314
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:09,329
But you're a little out of your depth.

315
00:29:09,354 --> 00:29:12,341
People who've amassed fortunes like your husband's...

316
00:29:12,427 --> 00:29:16,421
generally aren't okay with being cheated out of any of it.

317
00:29:21,497 --> 00:29:24,484
The drawing is his hold over me.

318
00:29:27,945 --> 00:29:32,950
He threatened me with police. Prison. The works.

319
00:29:35,326 --> 00:29:37,305
He controls me.

320
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,973
The contact with my son. Everything.

321
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:44,158
Leaving would never have been easy, but now it's impossible.

322
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,695
You can't fight.

323
00:29:47,139 --> 00:29:49,140
Just beg.

324
00:29:50,826 --> 00:29:53,787
In Vietnam I tried to love him again.

325
00:29:53,811 --> 00:29:56,798
I thought if there was love there he might give me my son back.

326
00:29:56,822 --> 00:30:00,809
We sat on that bloody boat watching the sunset,

327
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:03,797
imitating some earlier time in our lives.

328
00:30:03,821 --> 00:30:08,806
He seemed happy so I asked him, and he made me an offer.

329
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:12,836
He'd let me go, if I agreed never to see my son again.

330
00:30:15,218 --> 00:30:18,635
I expressed myself, and took Max ashore.

331
00:30:18,774 --> 00:30:20,770
He called us, contrite.

332
00:30:21,575 --> 00:30:26,567
And when we got back, I glimpsed some other woman diving off the boat, and then vanished.

333
00:30:28,851 --> 00:30:32,287
I never felt such envy. - You don't seem the jealous type.

334
00:30:32,312 --> 00:30:35,296
Of her freedom.

335
00:30:37,499 --> 00:30:40,164
You know how I dream of just diving off that boat?

336
00:30:40,544 --> 00:30:42,426
But you share a son.

337
00:30:42,582 --> 00:30:44,849
That's my life now.

338
00:30:45,285 --> 00:30:47,850
Did you know the drawing was a fake? - No.

339
00:30:47,874 --> 00:30:51,849
Tomas and I became close, maybe too close. I failed.

340
00:30:51,873 --> 00:30:56,405
Andrei can't conceive of failure. Only betrayal. But I didn't betray my husband.

341
00:30:56,502 --> 00:31:00,859
In retrospect, maybe I missed my chance. - And he let Arepo walk free.

342
00:31:00,883 --> 00:31:05,859
If you had actually met Arepo, as you claimed, you'd understand that he no longer walksâ€¦ anywhere.

343
00:31:05,883 --> 00:31:08,875
We spoke on the phone. - He can't do that either.

344
00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:10,877
Where's the drawing? - Why?

345
00:31:10,901 --> 00:31:14,518
Get me an introduction. I'll take the drawing out of the equation.

346
00:31:14,576 --> 00:31:17,880
No picture, no prosecution, no more hold over you.

347
00:31:17,904 --> 00:31:21,885
I might just be your second chance. - I don't need redemption.

348
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:23,918
At betrayal.

349
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:31,887
Friends of your husband's?

350
00:31:31,911 --> 00:31:35,890
You knew this was going to happen? - Don't worry, they won't kill you.

351
00:31:35,914 --> 00:31:38,897
Andrei dislikes tangling with local law enforcement on that level.

352
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:42,319
You must have really not liked the look of me. - The look was fine.

353
00:31:42,348 --> 00:31:46,902
It's best to get to the nasty part before I care one way or the other.

354
00:31:46,926 --> 00:31:50,913
There's a number in your left coat pocket. Don't call from home.

355
00:31:50,937 --> 00:31:52,947
You won't be taking my call.

356
00:31:54,805 --> 00:31:56,821
I might surprise you.

357
00:32:27,561 --> 00:32:31,546
I ordered my hot sauce an hour ago.

358
00:32:32,878 --> 00:32:34,131
Can we get going?

359
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:50,876
Please! - He wants you to see.

360
00:32:50,876 --> 00:33:16,829
<b><i>This Movie Is Downloaded From "MSMOVIESBD.COM"</i></b>

361
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,030
And he gets what he wants.

362
00:33:25,654 --> 00:33:27,656
Not always apparently.

363
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,339
Anna says We're going to Pompeii and see lava.

364
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:41,423
We will. We'll go together. I'll be there too.

365
00:34:00,453 --> 00:34:03,444
I told you I'd surprise you.

366
00:34:03,783 --> 00:34:05,790
He's a cute kid. - He's everything.

367
00:34:08,072 --> 00:34:10,050
Where's the drawing?

368
00:34:10,074 --> 00:34:13,075
Oslo, at the airport. - The airport?

369
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,198
Do you know what a Freeport is?

370
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:20,456
A storage facility for art that was acquiredâ€¦ - But not yet taxed.

371
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:22,673
He started a network.

372
00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:26,099
Rotas, his construction company, built them. I brought in the clients.

373
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,393
The facilities are tax havens.

374
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:30,863
The clients can view their investments without

375
00:34:30,864 --> 00:34:33,107
importing them, so they avoid paying tax.

376
00:34:33,717 --> 00:34:35,708
So It's sort of like a transit lounge for art?

377
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:39,045
Art, antiquities, anything of value really. - Anything?

378
00:34:39,451 --> 00:34:43,563
Anything legal. - But it's not unlike the Swiss banking system.

379
00:34:43,587 --> 00:34:45,579
Opaque.

380
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:50,093
As I'm sure you are aware, most Freeports are just warehouses,

381
00:34:50,117 --> 00:34:53,092
but here we ensure that you can enjoy...

382
00:34:53,116 --> 00:34:55,475
Rotas has assets in the Oslo Freeport. I'm guessing It's there.

383
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,129
And this way to the vaults.

384
00:34:57,615 --> 00:34:59,204
Guessing? - Guessing?

385
00:34:59,229 --> 00:35:01,712
We make trips there four, five times a year.

386
00:35:01,737 --> 00:35:04,035
To view art? - And whatever it is he does.

387
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:08,140
Turns out art's of no importance to Andrei. - But the Freeports are.

388
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:12,470
The structure of the vaults is based on the Pentagon.

389
00:35:12,495 --> 00:35:15,118
Each vault a separate structure within the other.

390
00:35:15,142 --> 00:35:18,137
Damage to one structure won't compromise the other.

391
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,168
Some customers choose biometric access control. You can go straight in...

392
00:35:35,158 --> 00:35:36,170
Off the tarmac.

393
00:35:36,848 --> 00:35:38,829
From the terminal?

394
00:35:38,854 --> 00:35:41,858
From their private planes. - Of course.

395
00:35:42,988 --> 00:35:45,734
Our logistics department ships to and from any other

396
00:35:45,759 --> 00:35:48,657
Freeport in the world without customs inspection.

397
00:35:49,173 --> 00:35:52,160
What are you hoping to find in there? - Do you really want to know?

398
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:56,156
I'm not sure. - Bring some lead-lined gloves.

399
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,164
Jesus, it' s nuclear?

400
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:03,196
When You're on the tour, pay attention to the fire precautions.

401
00:36:05,188 --> 00:36:08,158
Documents are vulnerable to... - Fire, absolutely?

402
00:36:08,183 --> 00:36:10,170
I was going to say, water damage from sprinkler systems.

403
00:36:10,194 --> 00:36:12,177
We don't use sprinklers.

404
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:17,606
The facility is flooded with Halide gas, displacing all the air within seconds.

405
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:22,195
Can you show me? - Well if I did, we'd suffocate.

406
00:36:23,202 --> 00:36:25,532
What about the staff? - Halide only fills the vaults,

407
00:36:25,577 --> 00:36:29,848
they just have to get into either corridor. And there is a 10 second warning.

408
00:36:29,912 --> 00:36:31,894
At least you give them 10 seconds.

409
00:36:32,094 --> 00:36:36,153
Well sir, our clients use us, because we have no priorities

410
00:36:36,178 --> 00:36:38,202
above their property.

411
00:36:38,226 --> 00:36:39,121
Blimey.

412
00:36:39,146 --> 00:36:41,921
All doors are fireproof. Hydraulic closers.

413
00:36:41,922 --> 00:36:43,904
Simple key and electronic triggers.

414
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:45,491
Surprisingly easy once they have been locked down.

415
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,208
Why a lockdown? - The power switches to fail-safe, securing the outer doors.

416
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:53,247
But the inner doors revert to factory settings.

417
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:56,413
You can pick the locks. Its child's play really.

418
00:36:56,438 --> 00:36:58,899
Child's play? You're inside airport security.

419
00:36:58,924 --> 00:37:02,029
They have to worry about climate control, not armed raids.

420
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:06,910
So how do we get enough firepower through the perimeter to trigger their lockdown procedure?

421
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,058
The back wall of the Freeport. - You've got something?

422
00:37:11,989 --> 00:37:13,969
You're not gonna like it.

423
00:37:14,257 --> 00:37:16,240
You want to crash a plane?

424
00:37:16,264 --> 00:37:18,498
Well, not from the air. don't be so dramatic.

425
00:37:18,687 --> 00:37:23,692
I want to run a jet off the taxi-way, breach through the wall, and start a fire.

426
00:37:25,751 --> 00:37:27,736
Well, how big a plane?

427
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:31,911
Well, that part is a little dramatic.

428
00:37:32,287 --> 00:37:36,255
This is Mahir. His team will work the plane.

429
00:37:36,279 --> 00:37:39,132
There can't be passengers. - Norsk Freight.

430
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:43,881
They use the hangar on the west side of the Freeport. - You want to crash a transport plane? What about the crew?

431
00:37:43,906 --> 00:37:46,887
We pop the slides, chuck â€˜em off. - On the move?

432
00:37:47,051 --> 00:37:49,043
What's the problem, they'll be fine.

433
00:37:49,302 --> 00:37:51,276
Well it seemsâ€¦ bold.

434
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,277
"Bold" I'm fine with. I thought you were gonna say "nuts".

435
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:56,282
And if you get caught? - We won't.

436
00:37:56,306 --> 00:37:58,285
And if you do?

437
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:01,288
Everyone assumes terrorism, but no one's died, so

438
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:05,318
a swift extradition, then lost in the system. It'll barely make the news.

439
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:10,298
That all depends on the size of your explosion. - Well actually the gold bars might get some play.

440
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:14,138
Gold bars? - Norsk Freight ships treasury gold once a month.

441
00:38:14,163 --> 00:38:17,307
Blow the back, drop it out on the runway.

442
00:38:17,332 --> 00:38:21,321
No one will be looking at the building. I guarantee you.

443
00:38:24,081 --> 00:38:28,066
The space in this inner pentagon is too big. There's something there.

444
00:38:28,335 --> 00:38:32,320
I can't figure it out, It's just not marked.

445
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:34,675
It's 45 seconds. - Ample.

446
00:38:34,997 --> 00:38:37,008
Won't you be running?

447
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:40,964
All right, it's your turn. Start packing.

448
00:38:57,372 --> 00:39:00,358
Gentlemen, if you would, through the detector please.

449
00:39:04,274 --> 00:39:07,576
Sir, and Sir.

450
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:20,164
Can I offer you perhaps a coffee? A water? - I'll take an espresso.

451
00:39:20,393 --> 00:39:24,382
Sir? - No thank you.

452
00:39:32,818 --> 00:39:37,628
Is everybody on this plane vegetarian? Cause all I got here is vegetarian.

453
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:43,853
So that one looks like meat, but I think that looks vegetarian. I think they both look vegetarian.

454
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:48,219
I don't know. Confusing, you know. Okay.

455
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:57,016
This way, gentlemen.

456
00:40:12,447 --> 00:40:15,428
Gentlemen, your central...

457
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:27,461
Carry on. Not the radio.

458
00:40:34,463 --> 00:40:36,465
Come on.

459
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,680
Yoga.

460
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,269
Let's go! Now!

461
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:45,536
Go, go, go.

462
00:42:21,073 --> 00:42:23,078
All right, I...

463
00:42:37,712 --> 00:42:39,711
You said ten seconds, right?

464
00:44:00,202 --> 00:44:02,371
There's someone in here with us.

465
00:44:16,814 --> 00:44:20,800
Do you need a hand? - Actually, yes.

466
00:44:46,822 --> 00:44:50,341
Don't touch them! -The hell happened here?

467
00:44:55,979 --> 00:44:57,991
It hasn't happened yet.

468
00:47:16,995 --> 00:47:18,576
don't kill him!

469
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:21,983
We need to know if We've been compromised.

470
00:47:23,209 --> 00:47:27,984
Why are you here? Who are you?

471
00:47:28,008 --> 00:47:30,001
How'd you know we'd be here?

472
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,075
We need to go.

473
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:53,495
What happened to the other guy?

474
00:47:54,089 --> 00:47:56,092
I took care of him.

475
00:48:11,098 --> 00:48:15,085
Well, I've seen too much. I'm still alive, which must mean you've decided to trust me.

476
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:19,451
Or maybe I've lost my edge? - Your edge is still intact.

477
00:48:20,948 --> 00:48:23,930
There's a Cold War. - Nuclear?

478
00:48:24,111 --> 00:48:26,131
Temporal.

479
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,103
Time travel? - No.

480
00:48:29,127 --> 00:48:32,896
Technology that can invert an object 's entropy.

481
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:38,844
You mean reverse chronology, like Feynman and Wheeler's notion that a positron's an electron moving backwards in time?

482
00:48:38,887 --> 00:48:42,162
Sure, that's exactly what I meant. - I have a Masters in Physics.

483
00:48:42,187 --> 00:48:45,348
Well, try and keep up. - I mean the implications of this are...

484
00:48:45,373 --> 00:48:47,962
Beyond secret. - Then why did you bring me in?

485
00:48:47,987 --> 00:48:50,755
I thought we'd find a drawing and a couple boxes of bullets.

486
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:55,153
Not as surprised as I was. - I'm going back to Mumbai to get some answers.

487
00:48:56,546 --> 00:48:59,162
I'll set you up as a go-between, but remember to you...

488
00:49:00,165 --> 00:49:03,135
It's all about plutonium.

489
00:49:03,159 --> 00:49:07,148
Or when we're done, they'll kill you. - Won't you have to do that anyway?

490
00:49:07,172 --> 00:49:12,162
I rather that be my decision. - So would I. I think.

491
00:49:24,596 --> 00:49:27,049
Your work?

492
00:49:28,024 --> 00:49:29,810
What did you find in the vaults?

493
00:49:29,835 --> 00:49:32,664
Two antagonists. One inverted.

494
00:49:32,787 --> 00:49:36,635
We took out the regular one, but the inverted one got away.

495
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,651
Both emerged at the same moment? - Yeah.

496
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:41,203
They were the same person.

497
00:49:42,205 --> 00:49:46,170
Sator has built a Turnstile in that vault. - A Turnstile?

498
00:49:46,194 --> 00:49:48,589
A machine, for inverting.

499
00:49:48,614 --> 00:49:51,184
You told me that technology hasn't been invented yet.

500
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:55,196
It hasn't, he's been given it by the future. - For what?

501
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:58,215
You have the best chance of finding out.

502
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:00,569
Have you met him? - I was close.

503
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:04,904
What if you have something he needs? - Such as?

504
00:50:04,929 --> 00:50:07,197
Plutonium-241.

505
00:50:07,221 --> 00:50:12,979
Sator tried to lift the only used 241 from under a CIA team at the opera siege in Kiev.

506
00:50:13,004 --> 00:50:16,107
He got the team. Not the 241.

507
00:50:16,132 --> 00:50:19,205
Who did? - Ukrainian security services.

508
00:50:19,229 --> 00:50:21,218
It's moving to Tallinn in a week.

509
00:50:21,242 --> 00:50:26,245
Helping an arms dealer steal weapons grade plutonium is unacceptable, Priya.

510
00:50:27,238 --> 00:50:30,937
I'm just gonna take him out. - No, no, no, no. No, Sator has to stay alive.

511
00:50:30,962 --> 00:50:33,939
He has to stay alive until we know his part in things.

512
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:37,856
Manage the situation without losing control of the 241.

513
00:50:37,881 --> 00:50:39,227
It's too dangerous.

514
00:50:39,251 --> 00:50:44,418
A terrorist bomb, even one that can kill billions, is nothing compared to what could happen if you don't stop Sator.

515
00:50:44,443 --> 00:50:50,253
From doing what? - We are being attacked by the future.

516
00:50:50,972 --> 00:50:54,540
And Sator's helping. You have to find out how.

517
00:51:10,046 --> 00:51:12,458
I saw the news from Oslo. Do you have the drawing?

518
00:51:12,483 --> 00:51:16,655
You don't have to worry about it anymore. - You destroyed it?

519
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,542
I didn't think you'd want it back. - Does he know?

520
00:51:19,567 --> 00:51:22,277
Not yet. So sit tight. - Sit tight?

521
00:51:22,301 --> 00:51:25,273
Every day my son spends with that monster, he thinks a little less of me.

522
00:51:25,297 --> 00:51:29,287
It won't be long. In the meantime, introduce me.

523
00:51:29,311 --> 00:51:33,911
As what? - I'm a former first secretary from the American Embassy in Riyadh.

524
00:51:33,936 --> 00:51:37,285
We met at party last June. - We were at a party in Riyadh, but I don't think it was in June.

525
00:51:37,309 --> 00:51:39,716
June 29, 7 to 7.30

526
00:51:39,741 --> 00:51:42,298
Salmon was on the printed menu, swapped for sea bass on the night.

527
00:51:42,322 --> 00:51:46,098
Sator left early, That's when we met. I came into Shipley's in London.

528
00:51:46,123 --> 00:51:49,302
You ran into me here, and want to show me your yacht.

529
00:51:49,326 --> 00:51:52,940
He'll think we're having an affair. - Then he'll want to meet me.

530
00:51:52,965 --> 00:51:55,952
Or have you killed. - Let me worry about that.

531
00:51:56,328 --> 00:51:58,323
Did I look worried?

532
00:51:59,341 --> 00:52:03,736
Sleeps 70 with crew. Two helicopters. Missile defenses.

533
00:52:03,761 --> 00:52:07,662
Afraid of pirates? - Andrei lives playing one government off the other.

534
00:52:07,863 --> 00:52:09,752
Till they turn, That's his refuge.

535
00:52:09,777 --> 00:52:13,330
May I join you? - Not sure Volkov's taking passengers just now.

536
00:52:13,354 --> 00:52:15,348
Then we'll take mine.

537
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,238
Max?

538
00:52:51,884 --> 00:52:54,378
Who's the American?

539
00:52:55,388 --> 00:52:58,876
He's a friend. - The man from Shipley's.

540
00:52:59,402 --> 00:53:02,387
That you tried to have beaten up.

541
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:05,070
I ask again. Who is he?

542
00:53:07,997 --> 00:53:10,920
We met in Riyadh last June at the American Embassy.

543
00:53:10,945 --> 00:53:15,391
Good with fists for a diplomat. - Paranoia is your department, Andrei.

544
00:53:15,415 --> 00:53:18,421
He seems nice. I invited him to the dinner.

545
00:53:18,914 --> 00:53:23,213
Max? â€“ He's visiting Pompeii and Herculaneum.

546
00:53:23,413 --> 00:53:27,408
You just sent him off? I promised him I'd go with him.

547
00:53:27,432 --> 00:53:30,343
I explained you were busy.

548
00:53:31,425 --> 00:53:33,435
With your friend.

549
00:53:54,759 --> 00:53:58,763
Hey, easy fella. Where I'm from, you buy me dinner first.

550
00:54:09,471 --> 00:54:12,459
Mr. Sator. - don't bother.

551
00:54:13,475 --> 00:54:16,398
Just tell me if you've slept with my wife yet.

552
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:19,445
Ahhh, no.

553
00:54:19,469 --> 00:54:20,485
Not yet.

554
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,488
How would you like to die?

555
00:54:24,118 --> 00:54:27,135
Old. - You chose the wrong profession.

556
00:54:29,485 --> 00:54:34,044
There is a walled garden up the road. We're going to take you there and cut your throat.

557
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:37,056
Not across. In the middle, like a hole.

558
00:54:37,195 --> 00:54:41,183
Then we take your balls and we stuff them in the cut to block the windpipe.

559
00:54:42,139 --> 00:54:42,988
Complex!

560
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:45,993
It's very gratifying to watch a man you don't like...

561
00:54:46,251 --> 00:54:50,231
try to pull his own balls out of his throat before he chokes.

562
00:54:50,256 --> 00:54:53,261
Is this how you treat all your guests? - We're finished.

563
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,710
Do you like opera?

564
00:55:05,241 --> 00:55:08,403
What? - Not here.

565
00:55:11,304 --> 00:55:13,506
You sail? - Iâ€˜ve messed around on boats.

566
00:55:13,531 --> 00:55:18,523
Be on the dock at 8 ready to do more than mess around. â€“ 8 a.m.

567
00:55:32,553 --> 00:55:36,524
Max missed too much school this year. I'm taking him back to England.

568
00:55:36,548 --> 00:55:38,537
School won't be okay with him missing so much. - Yes, they will.

569
00:55:38,561 --> 00:55:40,540
Can I finish?

570
00:55:40,564 --> 00:55:43,004
You want the trappings of a king.

571
00:55:43,029 --> 00:55:47,562
We both know You're a grubby little man playing power games with a wife that doesn't love you anymore.

572
00:55:48,569 --> 00:55:51,401
You seem...

573
00:55:51,426 --> 00:55:53,423
spirited today.

574
00:55:54,576 --> 00:55:57,564
Do I? - Yes, you do.

575
00:56:03,389 --> 00:56:05,380
Were you worried it had been destroyed?

576
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:10,027
Rest assured, instinct told me to remove it from the vault.

577
00:56:10,052 --> 00:56:12,063
I've always had instincts about the future.

578
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:19,206
That's how I built this life you no longer value.

579
00:56:32,607 --> 00:56:35,608
Sailing or diving?

580
00:56:51,627 --> 00:56:53,728
Rising!

581
00:57:17,211 --> 00:57:19,223
What do you know about opera?

582
00:57:20,048 --> 00:57:25,051
In 2008 a remote Russian missile station was overwhelmed and held for a week.

583
00:57:25,671 --> 00:57:27,970
When the station was retaken...

584
00:57:27,995 --> 00:57:31,692
the 241 on one warhead was three quarters of a kilo lighter.

585
00:57:35,676 --> 00:57:37,655
The missing 241...

586
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,661
surfaced at the opera house siege in Kiev on the 14th.

587
00:57:40,685 --> 00:57:42,681
Coming about!

588
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:02,707
What do you propose?

589
00:58:03,706 --> 00:58:06,711
A partnership. - I wouldn't partner with you.

590
00:58:06,736 --> 00:58:10,721
You can take care of yourself. You have no record.

591
00:58:11,203 --> 00:58:15,183
Someone in the arms trade with training. Knows how to cover his tracks.

592
00:58:15,382 --> 00:58:18,377
Not that shocking. For an intelligence agent.

593
00:58:18,724 --> 00:58:20,721
Right!

594
00:58:23,397 --> 00:58:25,999
Burn in hell, Andrei!

595
00:58:32,314 --> 00:58:36,223
You can't turn the boat like this! - You can if you have to!

596
00:59:03,227 --> 00:59:06,215
Why didn't you let him drown? - I need him.

597
00:59:06,767 --> 00:59:09,234
To sell guns? - I'm not who you think I am.

598
00:59:09,259 --> 00:59:12,260
Of that I know. He showed me the drawing.

599
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:17,759
I'm sorry. I had to get close to him. I don't know what you think your husband does.

600
00:59:17,783 --> 00:59:20,423
Oh, we both know he's an arms dealer.

601
00:59:20,448 --> 00:59:23,108
He's so much more. - What then?

602
00:59:23,133 --> 00:59:27,438
Andrei Sator holds all of our lives in his hands, not just yours.

603
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:37,131
Mr. Sator wants to see you. - Okay.

604
00:59:38,086 --> 00:59:40,073
Now.

605
00:59:40,252 --> 00:59:42,960
Uh, he wants to see me without pants?

606
00:59:48,569 --> 00:59:52,572
Trust me. - Save it. I'm not falling for it twice.

607
00:59:54,659 --> 00:59:57,646
You have a better option?

608
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:03,654
Whatever it takes to get what you want. Not a second thought for me or my son.

609
01:00:08,193 --> 01:00:10,835
What do you think he's going to do to me now?

610
01:00:21,847 --> 01:00:24,837
Try not to use it.

611
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:27,288
On anyone.

612
01:00:32,201 --> 01:00:34,205
Enough!

613
01:00:37,393 --> 01:00:40,391
See? A pulse of a man half my age.

614
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,412
Drink with me.

615
01:00:47,093 --> 01:00:49,080
It seems I now owe you my life.

616
01:00:49,748 --> 01:00:52,723
It was nothing. - My life is not nothing.

617
01:00:52,748 --> 01:00:55,445
And I don't like to be in debt.

618
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:59,481
Then pay me. No retribution against your wife.

619
01:01:02,778 --> 01:01:05,763
You think she released my harness?

620
01:01:06,561 --> 01:01:14,184
Hm. It was my own mistake. - Then help me steal the 241. I need resources.

621
01:01:14,209 --> 01:01:17,515
It's weapons grade plutonium. That means special handling. Containment facilities.

622
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,549
I know what it means.

623
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,003
You lecture me about radiation.

624
01:01:25,012 --> 01:01:26,992
Andrei Sator,

625
01:01:27,065 --> 01:01:31,062
digging plutonium from the rubble of my city as a teenager.

626
01:01:31,917 --> 01:01:33,919
Where?

627
01:01:35,688 --> 01:01:37,688
Stalsk 12.

628
01:01:39,424 --> 01:01:41,432
My home.

629
01:01:42,945 --> 01:01:48,218
One part of a warhead exploded at ground level, scattering the others.

630
01:01:49,137 --> 01:01:52,925
They needed people to find the plutonium.

631
01:01:53,711 --> 01:02:00,147
It became my first contract. Nobody else even bid. They thought it was a death sentence.

632
01:02:02,008 --> 01:02:03,031
But...

633
01:02:04,403 --> 01:02:07,399
one man's probability of death...

634
01:02:09,403 --> 01:02:14,368
is another man's possibility for a life.

635
01:02:16,062 --> 01:02:19,047
I staked my claim in the new Russia.

636
01:02:19,414 --> 01:02:23,414
Even now, my company is the only one to operate in the ruins.

637
01:02:24,415 --> 01:02:27,398
The 241 is being transported through Northern Europe...

638
01:02:27,422 --> 01:02:31,428
on its way to the long term nuclear storage depot in Trieste.

639
01:02:32,914 --> 01:02:34,922
I'm told you have resources in Tallinn.

640
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:43,458
Stay with us tonight. I insist.

641
01:03:11,229 --> 01:03:14,238
What do you want? - We're going to talk about today.

642
01:03:15,745 --> 01:03:17,750
No, we're not. - No?

643
01:03:19,245 --> 01:03:21,217
We'll see.

644
01:03:21,241 --> 01:03:25,251
don't think for a second you can treat me like you treat your other women.

645
01:03:27,233 --> 01:03:29,233
And...

646
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:32,081
how do you imagine...

647
01:03:32,944 --> 01:03:36,930
I treat these other women, huh? Do you think I force them into conversation?

648
01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:40,860
You want to be quiet? Fine. You can bite down on that.

649
01:03:43,258 --> 01:03:47,251
Even a soul as blank and brittle as yours needs a response.

650
01:03:48,265 --> 01:03:52,234
Is fear and pain enough, Andrei? It's all I have to offer you.

651
01:03:52,259 --> 01:03:56,249
Well, that will have to do then. - Why don't you just let me go?

652
01:03:56,273 --> 01:03:58,275
Because...

653
01:04:00,277 --> 01:04:05,273
if I can't have you...

654
01:04:06,288 --> 01:04:09,279
no one else can.

655
01:04:10,289 --> 01:04:13,266
And if you touch me, I scream so loud he hears.

656
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:18,263
You think I'll let him interfere? - If you try to, you'd have to kill him.

657
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:20,295
End of deal.

658
01:04:21,289 --> 01:04:23,292
So you leave me alone.

659
01:04:25,158 --> 01:04:26,717
Not now!

660
01:06:46,034 --> 01:06:50,039
98. Not bad for such exertion.

661
01:07:02,041 --> 01:07:04,038
He was at the window.

662
01:07:05,043 --> 01:07:07,054
I was curious.

663
01:07:07,752 --> 01:07:09,775
My property shouldn't concern you.

664
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:14,443
Who are you? How do you come by your information about the opera?

665
01:07:14,468 --> 01:07:19,033
You wouldn't do business with someone who wasn't savvy enough to be recruited.

666
01:07:19,057 --> 01:07:22,047
Now the CIA provides two-thirds of the market for fissile material.

667
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:25,060
They're usually buying, not selling.

668
01:07:26,063 --> 01:07:30,055
But we do live in a twilight world. - Is that Whitman? Pretty.

669
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:33,075
Next one is a bullet in the brain.

670
01:07:34,763 --> 01:07:36,751
No balls in my throat?

671
01:07:37,078 --> 01:07:40,047
There will be no time for such things...

672
01:07:40,071 --> 01:07:41,065
in Tallinn.

673
01:07:41,089 --> 01:07:45,064
You make your way there. I want Volkov on your team.

674
01:07:45,088 --> 01:07:47,089
No.

675
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:54,636
I spring the material. You pay me off. And your wife does the exchange.

676
01:07:54,661 --> 01:07:58,083
I never involve her in my business. - Yeah, That's why I trust her.

677
01:07:58,107 --> 01:08:00,085
Put him ashore.

678
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:02,713
How do I contact you? - You don't.

679
01:08:02,738 --> 01:08:06,100
How do you advance me the funds?

680
01:08:08,114 --> 01:08:11,117
Handle the plutonium better than that.

681
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:24,907
What did you find on the gold? - No franks, no mold marks. Nothing.

682
01:08:24,932 --> 01:08:27,109
How? - Dead drops.

683
01:08:27,133 --> 01:08:30,115
He buries his time capsule, transmits the location,

684
01:08:30,139 --> 01:08:34,108
then digs it up to collect the inverted materials they send him.

685
01:08:34,132 --> 01:08:36,997
Seemingly instantaneous. Where does he bury it?

686
01:08:37,022 --> 01:08:39,997
Some place that won't be discovered for centuries.

687
01:08:40,022 --> 01:08:42,124
What did the soil samples show?

688
01:08:42,148 --> 01:08:45,941
Northern Europe. Asia. Radioactive.

689
01:08:45,966 --> 01:08:49,158
Everything salvaged from Oslo has been shipped here.

690
01:08:49,798 --> 01:08:53,811
Why am I here? - I don't trust anyone else to assess the pieces.

691
01:08:54,943 --> 01:08:56,936
My convoy through downtown. What's the thinking?

692
01:08:57,295 --> 01:09:00,144
Crowded. Unpredictable traffic patterns.

693
01:09:00,168 --> 01:09:02,171
It's almost impossible to plan an ambush.

694
01:09:02,664 --> 01:09:06,423
You have a point. Is the convoy monitored from the air?

695
01:09:06,448 --> 01:09:10,151
Tracked by GPS. One wrong turn, in come the cavalry.

696
01:09:10,175 --> 01:09:14,150
We need big guns. Guns that'll make the point without being fired.

697
01:09:14,174 --> 01:09:18,378
A fast car that doesn't look fast. Four heavy vehicles. All different.

698
01:09:18,403 --> 01:09:22,167
A bus, a coach, an eighteen wheeler. One of them has to be a fire truck.

699
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:25,771
Most of all, we have to set this up with nothing in the record.

700
01:09:25,796 --> 01:09:27,994
Nothing electronic. Nothing paper.

701
01:09:28,019 --> 01:09:32,033
I don't want Sator ambushing us once we spring the material.

702
01:09:32,058 --> 01:09:35,189
His ignorance is our only protection.

703
01:10:11,984 --> 01:10:16,977
You see, Kat. Some of my favorites.

704
01:10:17,991 --> 01:10:23,173
Singed, but ah, salvageable, wouldn't you say?

705
01:10:23,198 --> 01:10:25,967
It's not my area of expertise. - Ah That's right,

706
01:10:25,991 --> 01:10:29,005
you would never have anything to do with such things.

707
01:10:30,002 --> 01:10:32,972
But this is where our worlds collide.

708
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:37,016
What is this, Andrei? - You know perfectly well what it is, Kat.

709
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:42,016
The filthy business...

710
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:45,775
that put those clothes on your back and our boy in his school.

711
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,052
That you thought you could negotiate your way around.

712
01:10:49,045 --> 01:10:51,047
The convoy in ten minutes.

713
01:10:58,125 --> 01:11:00,699
Time to go. - I'm not going anywhere with you.

714
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:02,715
Look at me!

715
01:11:02,739 --> 01:11:05,702
And understand...

716
01:11:05,726 --> 01:11:08,606
you don't negotiate with a tiger.

717
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:12,311
You admire a tiger until it turns on you...

718
01:11:12,462 --> 01:11:17,087
and you feel It's true fucking nature!

719
01:11:17,453 --> 01:11:19,437
don't.

720
01:11:19,737 --> 01:11:21,740
You stay right there.

721
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:28,369
Green, two minutes.

722
01:11:51,572 --> 01:11:54,402
You're not going to kill me. - I already tried.

723
01:11:54,427 --> 01:11:58,134
You pushed me off a boat, you are not going to shoot me in cold blood.

724
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:00,165
My blood's not cold, Andrei.

725
01:12:00,776 --> 01:12:03,782
No, but you're not angry enough.

726
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:09,572
Because anger scars over into despair.

727
01:12:10,795 --> 01:12:12,802
I look in your eyes...

728
01:12:14,792 --> 01:12:16,471
I see despair.

729
01:12:19,808 --> 01:12:23,243
Vengeful bitch! Living off me.

730
01:12:23,268 --> 01:12:27,252
Thinking that you're better! Enough!

731
01:12:50,829 --> 01:12:53,545
Tell me everything as it happens.

732
01:12:55,833 --> 01:12:57,414
Seal me this side.

733
01:13:14,857 --> 01:13:18,861
Yellow, 60 seconds. - 60, check.

734
01:13:33,733 --> 01:13:37,747
Blue, 45 seconds. - Blue, 45, check.

735
01:13:54,694 --> 01:13:57,656
Okay, Red. We're coming to you.

736
01:14:06,332 --> 01:14:08,324
The three trucks are in place.

737
01:14:12,168 --> 01:14:15,162
Watch everything. Give me all the details.

738
01:15:00,213 --> 01:15:02,211
All right, box set?

739
01:15:07,223 --> 01:15:09,225
Five.

740
01:15:10,223 --> 01:15:11,234
Four.

741
01:15:12,234 --> 01:15:16,189
Three, Two.

742
01:15:17,996 --> 01:15:18,997
One.

743
01:15:41,261 --> 01:15:42,263
Now, Yellow!

744
01:15:46,259 --> 01:15:50,271
We have a problem! - We need reinforcement! Shit!

745
01:16:01,821 --> 01:16:09,023
The radio is down. - Are they still in motion? Yep. - Okay.

746
01:17:56,933 --> 01:17:58,935
Check the radio chatter.

747
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:19,800
I've seen samples of encapsulation in every weapons class. This is not one of them.

748
01:18:19,825 --> 01:18:21,834
That's what he's after.

749
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:27,943
I can't understand this. - You said you spoke Estonian.

750
01:18:27,967 --> 01:18:31,966
It's not Estonian. It's backwards.

751
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:37,978
What the hell is that?

752
01:18:52,515 --> 01:18:53,602
Go, go, go, go!

753
01:19:40,049 --> 01:19:42,049
don't give it to him.

754
01:19:43,029 --> 01:19:46,068
This isn't plutonium. - It's worse than that, goddammit!

755
01:20:03,669 --> 01:20:04,833
Sorry.

756
01:20:21,079 --> 01:20:22,891
He's getting away.

757
01:20:24,082 --> 01:20:28,076
He left her in the car! Go after her! Go, go, go, go, go!

758
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:42,106
Pull up along side.

759
01:20:58,117 --> 01:21:00,127
Come on, come on. Closer!

760
01:21:04,128 --> 01:21:06,117
Keep it steady! Keep it steady!

761
01:21:07,487 --> 01:21:08,973
Hurry up!

762
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:12,563
Come on!

763
01:21:47,376 --> 01:21:53,176
Sit tight. I'm calling in the cavalry. - What cavalry?

764
01:22:57,247 --> 01:23:01,228
If you are not telling the truth, she dies.

765
01:23:02,247 --> 01:23:07,238
I don't know what you're talking about. - You left it in the car, not the firetruck, right?

766
01:23:07,782 --> 01:23:12,236
Who told you that? - Just tell me if it's in the BMW.

767
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:16,248
I don't know. - Tell me or I'll shoot her again.

768
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:18,855
Leave her alone! - Kill him!

769
01:23:19,269 --> 01:23:21,267
I do not have time to negotiate.

770
01:23:26,796 --> 01:23:27,844
Listen to me. - Three.

771
01:23:27,869 --> 01:23:31,086
I can help you. - Two.

772
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:34,264
don't! - One.

773
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:39,953
Next one's a bullet through the head.

774
01:23:39,977 --> 01:23:41,947
No. - One.

775
01:23:41,971 --> 01:23:43,396
Two, Three.

776
01:23:43,576 --> 01:23:45,555
Okay! Okay.

777
01:23:45,657 --> 01:23:50,654
The car. The BMW. I left it in the BMW. - We're going to check this is real.

778
01:23:52,988 --> 01:23:54,990
It's in the glove box!

779
01:23:55,425 --> 01:23:56,444
Where did you leave it?

780
01:23:57,446 --> 01:23:59,451
The car or fire truck? Which one?

781
01:24:00,432 --> 01:24:03,074
Which vehicle did you leave it in? I need to know before I go out there.

782
01:24:03,099 --> 01:24:06,103
I already told you. - I believe you.

783
01:24:06,134 --> 01:24:09,137
You wanted her here, I hope You'll be happy...

784
01:24:20,859 --> 01:24:24,824
Clear! - Wheeler, go check the other side.

785
01:24:24,848 --> 01:24:25,835
You two!

786
01:24:25,859 --> 01:24:28,693
Where did he go? - The past.

787
01:24:50,892 --> 01:24:54,893
It's in the glove box! - We're going to check this is real.

788
01:24:57,898 --> 01:25:00,870
Three, two, one. - Okay! Okay.

789
01:25:00,895 --> 01:25:02,903
Next one's a bullet through the head.

790
01:25:03,897 --> 01:25:05,905
No. No! - One.

791
01:25:06,485 --> 01:25:08,919
Listen to me. - Two, Three.

792
01:25:09,904 --> 01:25:12,890
I can help you. - I don't have time to negotiate.

793
01:25:12,914 --> 01:25:15,888
Tell me or I'll shoot her again.

794
01:25:15,912 --> 01:25:18,885
Leave her alone! - Tell me now, is it really in the BMW?

795
01:25:18,909 --> 01:25:19,893
I don't know.

796
01:25:19,917 --> 01:25:23,922
You left it in the car, not the firetruck, right? - Who told you that?

797
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:28,923
If you are not telling the truth, she dies. - I don't know what you're talking about.

798
01:25:41,014 --> 01:25:45,022
Medic! - What's her status?

799
01:25:45,629 --> 01:25:47,712
Bring her by this side.

800
01:25:48,394 --> 01:25:51,017
Is she shot with an inverted round?

801
01:25:55,883 --> 01:25:58,392
This is Ives. He's one of us.

802
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:03,384
"Us"? Who are these guys? - Priya's, ours.

803
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:06,994
How did Sator know about the ambush? - It's posterity.

804
01:26:07,019 --> 01:26:09,052
An ambush in the middle of the street can't stay out of the records.

805
01:26:09,077 --> 01:26:13,748
Bullshit! He knew every move we made! Every one of them! Somebody talked! Who was it?

806
01:26:13,773 --> 01:26:15,402
Was it you? - No. No.

807
01:26:16,136 --> 01:26:20,853
At every stage, you've known too much. I'm going to ask you again.

808
01:26:21,874 --> 01:26:23,876
Did you talk?

809
01:26:25,413 --> 01:26:29,417
Nobody talked. We're running a temporal pincer movement.

810
01:26:29,442 --> 01:26:35,414
A what? - A pincer movement. But not in space. In time.

811
01:26:35,439 --> 01:26:38,370
Half his team moves forward through the event.

812
01:26:38,395 --> 01:26:40,919
He monitors them, and then attacks at the end moving backwards.

813
01:26:40,944 --> 01:26:44,936
Knowing everything. - Except for where I stashed the plutonium.

814
01:26:44,961 --> 01:26:48,287
Which isn't really plutonium, is it? - I told you it is what he was after.

815
01:26:48,312 --> 01:26:50,449
And you just told him where it was.

816
01:26:51,447 --> 01:26:54,433
I lied.

817
01:26:54,458 --> 01:26:56,827
Jesus, you lied about it?

818
01:26:56,852 --> 01:27:01,179
He couldn't verify inside the room. He'd have shot her anyway.

819
01:27:01,204 --> 01:27:04,071
Lying is standard operating procedure.

820
01:27:04,096 --> 01:27:05,861
It has spread too far. - Meaning what?

821
01:27:05,886 --> 01:27:09,208
She's gonna die. - Standard operating procedure.

822
01:27:09,233 --> 01:27:11,297
can't, can't you help her, can't you do something?

823
01:27:11,322 --> 01:27:14,454
Can you stabilize the inverse radiation by inverting the patient?

824
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:16,184
It takes days. â€“ Lets go!

825
01:27:16,209 --> 01:27:19,778
We took control of this machine minutes ago. Before that it was Sator's.

826
01:27:19,803 --> 01:27:23,529
How long is she going to live on this side? - Three hours, tops.

827
01:27:23,554 --> 01:27:27,628
I'm taking her through. I'm not going to let her die. I'll take my chances.

828
01:27:27,653 --> 01:27:30,355
There's no way of bringing you back.

829
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:33,393
We find another machine. - A week ago? Where?

830
01:27:34,925 --> 01:27:39,268
Oslo. - That facility is inside an airport security perimeter.

831
01:27:39,293 --> 01:27:43,035
It's impregnable. - Mmm, it wasn't last week.

832
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:46,910
We're going in. You might as well help us.

833
01:27:46,935 --> 01:27:49,877
This is a proving window. As you approach the Turnstile,

834
01:27:49,902 --> 01:27:53,101
if you don't see yourself in the proving window, do not enter the machine.

835
01:27:53,126 --> 01:27:56,495
Why not? - If you don't see yourself reverse exit the machine, then you ain't getting out.

836
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:59,546
Is that gonna work? - Yeah.

837
01:27:59,571 --> 01:28:03,396
See for yourself. There's your answer. Let's go.

838
01:28:27,556 --> 01:28:31,123
She's stabilizing. I clean and closed, but the rest needs time.

839
01:28:31,148 --> 01:28:35,146
How long does she need? Four, five days. A week for sure.

840
01:28:36,074 --> 01:28:40,747
Neil, find a way to get us to Oslo. I'm going back out there.

841
01:28:40,772 --> 01:28:41,854
To do what?

842
01:28:41,879 --> 01:28:44,973
To stop Sator from getting away with whatever it is I just gave him.

843
01:28:44,998 --> 01:28:48,144
You didn't. You lied about where it was. Wait.

844
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:51,942
You're going out there for her. - He threatened to kill her in the past.

845
01:28:51,967 --> 01:28:56,563
If he does, what happens to her here? - That's unknowable.

846
01:28:56,587 --> 01:28:59,310
If You're there to make change, You're not here to observe its effect.

847
01:28:59,335 --> 01:29:02,569
But what do you believe? - What's happened happened.

848
01:29:02,593 --> 01:29:05,570
We need to save her, here and now.

849
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:08,956
If you go back out there, you might hand him exactly what he's after.

850
01:29:09,591 --> 01:29:11,613
Don't let them take her back through there.

851
01:29:12,486 --> 01:29:13,504
We can't stay here.

852
01:29:14,616 --> 01:29:20,549
We don't have a lot of time. So why don't you find us a nice, cozy shipping container...

853
01:29:20,574 --> 01:29:22,761
that's just come of a ship from Oslo.

854
01:29:22,786 --> 01:29:27,000
This is cowboy shit. You have no idea what You're getting yourself into if you go through that door.

855
01:29:27,025 --> 01:29:30,831
Well, I'm going. So any tips would be welcome. - Wheeler, brief him.

856
01:29:30,856 --> 01:29:35,596
You'll need your own air. Regular air won't pass through the membranes of inverted lungs.

857
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:38,455
Number one rule, don't come in contact

858
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:39,598
with your forward self.

859
01:29:39,623 --> 01:29:42,448
That's the whole point of these barriers and protective suits.

860
01:29:42,473 --> 01:29:46,111
We don't have time. - Well, if your particles come into contactâ€¦

861
01:29:46,136 --> 01:29:48,495
What? - Annihilation.

862
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,405
That would be bad, right?

863
01:29:50,430 --> 01:29:56,616
When you exit the airlock, take a moment to orient yourself. Things will feel strange.

864
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:58,622
When you run, the wind will be at your back.

865
01:29:58,646 --> 01:30:01,057
If you encounter fire, ice will form on your

866
01:30:01,058 --> 01:30:03,628
clothes as the transfer of heat is reversed.

867
01:30:03,652 --> 01:30:08,634
Gravity will feel normal, but be reversed for the world around you.

868
01:30:08,658 --> 01:30:12,638
You may experience distortions in your vision and hearing. This is normal.

869
01:30:12,662 --> 01:30:14,636
Can I drive a car? - Cowboy shit.

870
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:18,639
I can't vouch for the handling. Friction and wind resistance are reversed.

871
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:21,087
You are inverted. The world is not.

872
01:30:21,112 --> 01:30:24,460
Was the transponder on the case? - We've tossed that case.

873
01:30:24,666 --> 01:30:28,676
I'm moving backwards. That's the ball I have to follow. Give me the reader.

874
01:30:35,496 --> 01:30:37,212
Are you ready?

875
01:33:28,343 --> 01:33:31,331
The material is not in the case.

876
01:33:31,558 --> 01:33:36,834
Get the other sections of the algorithm to the hypocenter. He was lying.

877
01:33:36,859 --> 01:33:40,615
It wasn't in the BMW. - So where is it?

878
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:29,927
I saw the hand-off. You made me shoot her for nothing.

879
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:35,259
But you did get my pulse above 130. No one has done that before.

880
01:34:35,284 --> 01:34:37,919
Not even my wife.

881
01:35:06,471 --> 01:35:09,939
You left Ives and his team a hell of a clean-up.

882
01:35:09,963 --> 01:35:11,967
Heat transfer was reversed.

883
01:35:12,963 --> 01:35:16,968
You might be the first case of hypothermia from a gasoline explosion in history.

884
01:35:17,966 --> 01:35:19,965
At this point nothing surprises.

885
01:35:20,982 --> 01:35:24,944
We're headed back to Oslo? - In a Rotas shipping container.

886
01:35:24,968 --> 01:35:26,951
He's got the material, Neil.

887
01:35:26,975 --> 01:35:28,967
I handed it to him on a plate.

888
01:35:28,991 --> 01:35:33,466
I warned you. - What's happened happened. I get it now.

889
01:35:33,491 --> 01:35:36,974
But It's hard to take things on trust from people speaking half-truths.

890
01:35:36,998 --> 01:35:41,413
That's not fair. - You were a part of this before we met.

891
01:35:41,438 --> 01:35:43,444
Were you working for Priya? - No.

892
01:35:43,469 --> 01:35:48,009
Who recruited you, Neil? - It can't possibly do you any good to know that right now.

893
01:35:48,707 --> 01:35:53,014
When this is over, if We're still standing, and you still care,

894
01:35:53,682 --> 01:35:56,245
then you can hear my life story, okay?

895
01:35:58,999 --> 01:36:02,421
I'm sorry I involved you. - You need to tell me what's going on.

896
01:36:02,446 --> 01:36:06,311
Apparently Neil here knows more about it than I do. Good luck, pal.

897
01:36:06,336 --> 01:36:09,401
By telling Kat anything, We're compromising her in Priya's eyes.

898
01:36:09,426 --> 01:36:14,369
In Priya's eyes she's already compromised. She has the right to know why she might die.

899
01:36:14,394 --> 01:36:17,199
Am I gonna die? - Not if we have something to say about it.

900
01:36:17,224 --> 01:36:20,029
And we do. - Who are you?

901
01:36:21,034 --> 01:36:25,025
Let's start with the simple stuff. Every law of physics...

902
01:36:31,038 --> 01:36:33,020
The material is not in the case.

903
01:36:33,044 --> 01:36:37,042
Get the other sections of the algorithm to the hypocenter.

904
01:36:45,461 --> 01:36:47,463
Are you injured?

905
01:36:52,416 --> 01:36:54,418
What's the "algorithm", Neil?

906
01:36:56,087 --> 01:36:59,618
241 is one section of it. One out of nine.

907
01:37:00,845 --> 01:37:05,560
It's a formula, blended into physical form so it can't be copied or communicated.

908
01:37:05,913 --> 01:37:07,901
It's a black box with one function.

909
01:37:07,925 --> 01:37:10,375
Which is?

910
01:37:10,511 --> 01:37:13,372
Inversion. Not objects or people,

911
01:37:13,397 --> 01:37:16,107
but the world around us. - I don't understand.

912
01:37:16,132 --> 01:37:18,912
As they invert the entropy of more and more objects,

913
01:37:18,936 --> 01:37:22,911
the two directions of time are becoming more intertwined.

914
01:37:22,935 --> 01:37:26,440
Because the environment's entropy flows in our direction,

915
01:37:26,465 --> 01:37:30,616
we dominate. They're always swimming upstream. It's what saved your life.

916
01:37:30,641 --> 01:37:33,544
The inverted explosion was pushing against the environment.

917
01:37:33,569 --> 01:37:37,860
Pissing in the wind. - And the Algorithm, it'll change the direction of that wind.

918
01:37:37,885 --> 01:37:40,924
It can invert the entropy of the world.

919
01:37:40,949 --> 01:37:42,952
If that happens?

920
01:37:43,955 --> 01:37:47,933
Oh, end of play. - "End of play." Can you be a little more precise?

921
01:37:47,957 --> 01:37:49,885
Everyone and everything That's ever lived

922
01:37:49,910 --> 01:37:52,629
destroyed instantly. Precise enough?

923
01:37:52,654 --> 01:37:54,963
Including my son.

924
01:37:57,595 --> 01:38:02,445
The more you sleep, the faster You'll heal.

925
01:38:15,995 --> 01:38:18,001
On a truck.

926
01:38:20,079 --> 01:38:21,475
Shouldn't be long now.

927
01:38:22,633 --> 01:38:26,897
I've been thinking. We're their ancestors.

928
01:38:26,922 --> 01:38:29,973
If they destroy us, won't that destroy them?

929
01:38:29,997 --> 01:38:33,010
Which brings us to the grandfather paradox. - The what?

930
01:38:34,009 --> 01:38:37,118
If you went back in time and killed your own grandfather,

931
01:38:37,143 --> 01:38:39,169
how could you have been born to commit the act?

932
01:38:39,194 --> 01:38:42,465
What's the answer? - There's no answer. It's a paradox.

933
01:38:42,490 --> 01:38:45,567
But in the future, those in power clearly believe they can...

934
01:38:45,592 --> 01:38:48,035
kick grandpa down the stairs, gouge his eyes out,

935
01:38:49,017 --> 01:38:51,998
slit his throat, without consequence.

936
01:38:52,022 --> 01:38:55,297
Could they be right? - Doesn't matter.

937
01:38:55,322 --> 01:38:59,037
They believe it. Because they're willing to destroy us.

938
01:39:01,035 --> 01:39:04,154
Can I go back to sleep now? - No. I thought of something else.

939
01:39:04,179 --> 01:39:07,432
Great. - This reversing the flow of time,

940
01:39:07,457 --> 01:39:12,044
doesn't us being here now mean it never happens? That we stop them?

941
01:39:12,713 --> 01:39:16,316
Well, optimistically, I'd say That's right. - Pessimistically?

942
01:39:16,341 --> 01:39:19,815
In a parallel world's theory we can't know the relationship between...

943
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:23,685
consciousness and multiple realities. Does your head hurt yet?

944
01:39:23,710 --> 01:39:25,714
Yes.

945
01:39:28,784 --> 01:39:30,785
Try sleep.

946
01:39:45,134 --> 01:39:47,132
Shit.

947
01:39:47,756 --> 01:39:49,758
They didn't take us inside.

948
01:39:51,155 --> 01:39:53,160
What do we do?

949
01:39:56,200 --> 01:40:00,214
We use the breach. The chaos right after impact. Get ready.

950
01:40:02,339 --> 01:40:05,314
Has she healed enough?

951
01:40:05,339 --> 01:40:08,340
I don't know. I've never done this before.

952
01:40:08,933 --> 01:40:10,987
The fire crew's there.

953
01:40:11,012 --> 01:40:14,376
Take Kat to the breach. I take care of Sator's men and secure the vault.

954
01:40:14,401 --> 01:40:16,475
Then you bring her in.

955
01:40:17,710 --> 01:40:20,702
How is your arm? - Not good.

956
01:40:24,969 --> 01:40:27,999
We move as soon as we hear the engines.

957
01:40:31,098 --> 01:40:36,361
Hold on. - What? - You're bleeding. Let me take a look at it.

958
01:40:42,337 --> 01:40:44,330
Clear?

959
01:41:16,341 --> 01:41:18,349
Wait here. I'm going in.

960
01:43:15,223 --> 01:43:17,819
Come on! - Go, go, go!

961
01:43:48,323 --> 01:43:49,344
Now!

963
01:45:30,904 --> 01:45:34,102
You knew it was me coming out of that vault. Why didn't you say?

964
01:45:34,127 --> 01:45:37,230
That's a lot of explaining when someone's about to put a bullet in your own brain.

965
01:45:37,255 --> 01:45:41,312
But afterwards? - It's the same. I knew you'd be okay.

966
01:45:41,805 --> 01:45:46,362
What's happened happened. If I told you and you acted differently, who knows?

967
01:45:48,289 --> 01:45:50,792
The policy is to suppress.

968
01:45:50,923 --> 01:45:54,903
Whose policy? - Ours, my friend.

969
01:45:57,669 --> 01:46:01,669
We're the people saving the world from what might have been.

970
01:46:10,305 --> 01:46:12,037
Kat?

971
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:14,049
I'm here.

972
01:46:14,724 --> 01:46:17,723
There'll be quite a scar, but you'll be okay.

973
01:46:19,845 --> 01:46:22,465
You did it. - He did what?

974
01:46:23,188 --> 01:46:26,162
Andrei has the algorithm.

975
01:46:26,246 --> 01:46:28,259
You don't know where he is.

976
01:46:29,857 --> 01:46:32,071
Or when.

977
01:46:32,442 --> 01:46:34,839
Get Priya here to Oslo. - Why?

978
01:46:35,057 --> 01:46:37,837
If I don't do something, in two days she tells me about the 241.

979
01:46:37,904 --> 01:46:42,406
Nothing can change that. - We'll see. Just get her here.

980
01:46:45,093 --> 01:46:49,846
Hello, Priya. - What's going on? Where's Neil?

981
01:46:50,149 --> 01:46:54,094
Nursing Katherine Barton, who almost died because of you.

982
01:46:54,119 --> 01:46:56,086
What did I do? - It's what you're going to do.

983
01:46:56,111 --> 01:47:01,450
In two days You're going to have me dangle plutonium-241 in front of the world's most dangerous arms dealer.

984
01:47:01,475 --> 01:47:05,387
Now I want to know why? - You had Sator get hold of 241?

985
01:47:05,412 --> 01:47:07,775
No, I let him get ahold of the Algorithm.

986
01:47:08,770 --> 01:47:11,311
So tell me about it, Priya?

987
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:15,977
It's.. it's unique. The scientist who built it took her own life...

988
01:47:16,002 --> 01:47:17,509
so she couldn't be forced to make another.

989
01:47:17,534 --> 01:47:19,758
A scientist in the future? - Generations from now.

990
01:47:19,782 --> 01:47:23,802
Why does she have to kill herself? - You're familiar with the Manhattan project?

991
01:47:24,783 --> 01:47:28,260
As they approached the first atomic test, Oppenheimer became concerned that...

992
01:47:28,285 --> 01:47:32,316
the detonation might produce a chain reaction engulfing the world.

993
01:47:32,341 --> 01:47:37,809
They went ahead anyway and got lucky. - Think of our scientist as her generation's Oppenheimer.

994
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:41,462
She devises a method for inverting the world.

995
01:47:41,487 --> 01:47:45,496
Becomes convinced that by destroying us, they're destroying themselves.

996
01:47:45,804 --> 01:47:47,519
The grandfather paradox.

997
01:47:47,804 --> 01:47:50,882
But unlike Oppenheimer, she rebels.

998
01:47:51,096 --> 01:47:55,802
Splitting the Algorithm into nine sections and hiding them the best place she can think of.

999
01:47:56,195 --> 01:47:58,299
The past. Here, now.

1000
01:47:58,494 --> 01:48:02,246
There are nine nuclear powers. Nine bombs.

1001
01:48:02,421 --> 01:48:06,059
Nine sets of the most closely guarded materials in the history of the world.

1002
01:48:06,196 --> 01:48:10,248
The best hiding place possible. - Nuclear containment facilities.

1003
01:48:10,947 --> 01:48:14,171
Sator's lifelong mission, financed and guided by the future,

1004
01:48:14,207 --> 01:48:18,962
has been to find and reassemble the Algorithm. - Why did they choose him?

1005
01:48:18,987 --> 01:48:23,250
Because he was at the right place at the right time. - The collapse of the Soviet Union.

1006
01:48:23,275 --> 01:48:26,389
The most insecure moment in the history of nuclear weapons.

1007
01:48:26,662 --> 01:48:30,541
How many sections does he have? - After the 241, all nine.

1008
01:48:30,767 --> 01:48:35,632
Jesus Christ. And that's why you're going to do things differently this time.

1009
01:48:36,727 --> 01:48:39,647
To change things? So Katherine won't get hurt?

1010
01:48:39,672 --> 01:48:41,677
So Sator won't get the Algorithm.

1011
01:48:43,857 --> 01:48:47,569
If that universe can exist, we don't live in it.

1012
01:48:47,594 --> 01:48:52,508
Well, let's try. You're going to warn me? - No, I'm not.

1013
01:48:53,201 --> 01:48:55,360
Ignorance is our ammunition.

1014
01:48:55,780 --> 01:49:00,778
If you had known what the Algorithm was, would you have let it fallen into Sator's hands?

1015
01:49:01,959 --> 01:49:03,880
You want Sator to get the last section.

1016
01:49:03,905 --> 01:49:06,655
That is the only way he'll bring together the other eight.

1017
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:10,081
I was supposed to steal it, then lose it.

1018
01:49:10,106 --> 01:49:13,183
Mission accomplished. - You used me.

1019
01:49:14,184 --> 01:49:16,353
As you used Katherine.

1020
01:49:16,734 --> 01:49:18,747
Standard operating procedure.

1021
01:49:19,974 --> 01:49:22,784
You've done your part. - My part?

1022
01:49:23,314 --> 01:49:25,538
I'm the protagonist of this operation.

1023
01:49:25,851 --> 01:49:28,813
You are "a" protagonist.

1024
01:49:29,194 --> 01:49:32,481
Did you think you were the only one capable of saving the world?

1025
01:49:36,799 --> 01:49:43,962
No. But I am. Because I Haven't told you where he's assembling the Algorithm or when.

1026
01:49:44,050 --> 01:49:47,079
You're about to. - No. I'm not.

1027
01:49:47,104 --> 01:49:50,304
So deal us in. - "Us"?

1028
01:49:50,798 --> 01:49:53,842
Why would you want to involve her again? - Because she can get close to him.

1029
01:49:53,867 --> 01:49:56,603
Does he still trust her? - He thinks she's dead.

1030
01:49:56,628 --> 01:50:00,035
But he used to. - You have started looking at the world in a new way.

1031
01:50:00,142 --> 01:50:05,950
And now It's your turn. Assuming she makes it out alive. Whether or not you feel she knows too much.

1032
01:50:05,975 --> 01:50:09,663
I can't. - If you don't have the authority, then talk to whoever's in charge of loose ends.

1033
01:50:10,631 --> 01:50:15,174
I need your word that she and her son will be safe, Priya?

1034
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:18,190
What good is someone's word in our line of business?

1035
01:50:23,692 --> 01:50:25,768
They'll be safe.

1036
01:50:26,382 --> 01:50:30,393
There's a rally point offshore at Trondheim. Get yourselves up there.

1037
01:50:30,418 --> 01:50:33,776
Ives has a team ready to invert. - You have a Turnstile?

1038
01:50:33,801 --> 01:50:36,377
The exact technology We're trying to suppress.

1039
01:50:36,402 --> 01:50:39,094
Fighting fire with fire is a treacherous business.

1040
01:50:39,119 --> 01:50:42,474
But there are some people in the future who want to continue...

1041
01:50:42,499 --> 01:50:45,157
the Algorithm's journey into the past.

1042
01:50:45,757 --> 01:50:50,518
You see, Tenet wasn't founded in the past.

1043
01:50:50,543 --> 01:50:54,014
It will be founded in the future.

1044
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:23,419
Have you looked at the birds? - How are you feeling?

1045
01:51:28,701 --> 01:51:32,147
Tell me You're gonna kill him. - I can't.

1046
01:51:32,172 --> 01:51:35,172
Why not? I bet you've probably killed a lot of people.

1047
01:51:35,197 --> 01:51:39,390
Not with a dead man's switch. - The fitness tracker he wears.

1048
01:51:39,687 --> 01:51:42,600
He's obsessive about his health. - It'll be linked to a switch.

1049
01:51:42,625 --> 01:51:46,595
Probably a simple email burst that reveals the location of the dead drop.

1050
01:51:46,620 --> 01:51:48,597
Sets a fire, his heart stops.

1051
01:51:48,622 --> 01:51:52,478
His death activates the Algorithm. If he dies, the world ends.

1052
01:51:52,503 --> 01:51:54,378
No one dares kill him.

1053
01:51:56,473 --> 01:51:58,897
No, you've missed the point.

1054
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:02,942
He's intending to end his life.

1055
01:52:05,054 --> 01:52:06,401
Why?

1056
01:52:07,350 --> 01:52:09,373
He's dying.

1057
01:52:10,038 --> 01:52:12,041
Inoperable pancreatic cancer.

1058
01:52:13,611 --> 01:52:15,513
And he's taking the world with him.

1059
01:52:15,658 --> 01:52:17,818
If he can't have it, no one can.

1060
01:52:17,929 --> 01:52:22,246
He gets to choose a time and place for the end of the world.

1061
01:52:22,271 --> 01:52:24,601
What moment? What does he choose?

1062
01:52:26,549 --> 01:52:29,802
You told me about a holiday where you let him feel loved.

1063
01:52:29,827 --> 01:52:32,518
Vietnam. - You said he vanished. What day?

1064
01:52:32,543 --> 01:52:35,942
Well, I went ashore with Max. And he threw off. But I don't know what day it was.

1065
01:52:35,967 --> 01:52:39,147
It was the 14th. Ten days ago. He was in Ukraine.

1066
01:52:39,172 --> 01:52:43,010
At the Kiev Opera siege. How do you know about that?

1067
01:52:44,510 --> 01:52:46,677
The point is: he wasn't on his yacht. So that's his window.

1068
01:52:46,702 --> 01:52:49,526
To go back to that golden moment and have it be his last.

1069
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:54,253
Everyone's last. We have to lift the Algorithm from the dead drop without Sator knowing.

1070
01:52:54,278 --> 01:52:56,486
If he believes It's there, he kills himself.

1071
01:52:56,511 --> 01:52:58,013
But not the rest of us.

1072
01:52:58,068 --> 01:53:01,101
Where's the dead drop? - Knowledge divided, my friend.

1073
01:53:01,126 --> 01:53:04,216
You're not going to tell me. - Ignorance is our ammunition.

1074
01:53:04,241 --> 01:53:06,843
But I need you back on that yacht, Kat. - Why?

1075
01:53:07,111 --> 01:53:12,022
You have to stop him killing himself until we know the Algorithm is out of the dead drop.

1076
01:53:12,303 --> 01:53:16,152
But if I'm caught, then my son sees. I don't want those moments to be full of anguish...

1077
01:53:16,177 --> 01:53:18,179
if they're going to be his last.

1078
01:53:19,031 --> 01:53:21,033
They're not.

1079
01:53:45,273 --> 01:53:49,839
Let's talk. We're working our way back to the 14th, but without knowing where the dead drop is...

1080
01:53:49,864 --> 01:53:52,467
there's only so much I can do to prepare.

1081
01:53:53,223 --> 01:53:55,513
Do you know what a hypocenter is?

1082
01:53:56,648 --> 01:53:58,915
It's ground zero for an underground nuclear test.

1083
01:53:58,940 --> 01:54:03,987
Sir Michael Crosby told me about a detonation in Stalsk 12 on the 14th.

1084
01:54:04,222 --> 01:54:06,468
The dead drop is at the bottom of the hypocenter.

1085
01:54:06,493 --> 01:54:09,627
That explosion seals up the algorithm.

1086
01:54:09,652 --> 01:54:13,311
Then we better get it out of that hole before the bomb goes off then.

1087
01:54:15,334 --> 01:54:17,355
Line up. Move forward.

1088
01:54:20,877 --> 01:54:22,877
Next.

1089
01:54:25,349 --> 01:54:27,346
Line up.

1090
01:54:28,804 --> 01:54:29,826
Where's Neil?

1091
01:54:33,051 --> 01:54:35,841
He must have gone through already. - I didn't get to say goodbye.

1092
01:54:36,154 --> 01:54:40,856
This is goodbye, isn't it? - I'd like to say that you don't have to do this, Kat.

1093
01:54:40,881 --> 01:54:43,871
The worse thing Andrei ever did to me was that offer he made me...

1094
01:54:44,821 --> 01:54:47,824
Let me go if I agreed never to see my son again.

1095
01:54:49,021 --> 01:54:52,363
I shouted and swore.

1096
01:54:53,437 --> 01:54:55,861
But he'd seen it on my face, just for an instant.

1097
01:54:59,084 --> 01:55:03,359
I considered it. I don't know if I hate him more for what he's done,

1098
01:55:03,674 --> 01:55:06,686
or because he knows that about me.

1099
01:55:09,233 --> 01:55:12,242
A chance to help save my child. You can't know what that means to a mother.

1100
01:55:12,974 --> 01:55:15,739
No. - You've killed people you've hated before.

1101
01:55:16,183 --> 01:55:19,562
It's not usually personal. - Well, he's dying anyway. Maybe it doesn't even count.

1102
01:55:19,587 --> 01:55:24,395
It always counts, Kat. You're not there to kill him. You're the backstop.

1103
01:55:25,326 --> 01:55:28,074
If we don't lift that Algorithm, and he kills himself,

1104
01:55:28,099 --> 01:55:30,960
he takes us all with him.

1105
01:55:32,454 --> 01:55:35,070
You just keep up your end, okay?

1106
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:42,843
Today's the 14th. Offshore of Siberia. Time for us to go.

1107
01:55:43,278 --> 01:55:46,369
You keep moving back another day, It'll give you some time to get back into Vietnam.

1108
01:55:46,394 --> 01:55:48,803
Who gets me on the yacht? - I've got somebody good lined up.

1109
01:55:48,828 --> 01:55:51,995
When It's over, and You're raising your boy, carry this.

1110
01:55:52,676 --> 01:55:55,132
There may be a time and place you feel threatened.

1111
01:55:55,157 --> 01:55:58,150
Hit "Talk", state your location, hang up.

1112
01:55:58,175 --> 01:56:02,171
Who gets the message? - Posterity.

1113
01:56:41,313 --> 01:56:46,315
Stalsk 12. Hidden from the world. A city where anything can happen.

1114
01:56:46,340 --> 01:56:50,767
And today, ladies and gents, in ten minutes, it most assuredly does.

1115
01:56:50,792 --> 01:56:54,202
You've been divided into two teams for a temporal pincer movement.

1116
01:56:54,227 --> 01:56:58,484
We are Red Team, moving forward. In order to distinguish the teams, you'll wear these.

1117
01:56:58,509 --> 01:57:02,376
Our friends over there, Blue Team, led by Commander Wheeler, are inverted.

1118
01:57:02,401 --> 01:57:06,157
Why won't they let us see them? - Maybe we won't like what happened.

1119
01:57:06,182 --> 01:57:09,130
One hour from now they have this briefing.

1120
01:57:10,853 --> 01:57:14,321
Then we'll drop them on the ridge above the hypocenter...

1121
01:57:14,346 --> 01:57:16,659
as close in time to the detonation as possible.

1122
01:57:16,684 --> 01:57:20,496
Their objectives were clearance and clarification.

1123
01:57:20,799 --> 01:57:24,468
Now this briefing has the benefit of their experience.

1124
01:57:41,096 --> 01:57:46,076
Both teams have countdown watches. Ours counts down from ten, from landing,

1125
01:57:46,101 --> 01:57:49,401
to zero, to the explosion. Blue Team is reversed.

1126
01:57:49,426 --> 01:57:52,140
If you are not at the LZ at zero,

1127
01:57:52,165 --> 01:57:55,700
you are not leaving. You understand?

1128
01:57:56,221 --> 01:57:58,416
We drop in, clear LZ for the

1129
01:57:58,441 --> 01:58:01,480
Blue Team evacuation. Then we make our way into the city proper.

1130
01:58:01,505 --> 01:58:05,630
These buildings are abandoned, but we learned there is a Turnstile.

1131
01:58:05,831 --> 01:58:09,588
Expect a bitemporal response. - They'll have inverse ordinance?

1132
01:58:09,613 --> 01:58:15,104
Inverse, conventional, forward antagonists, inverted antagonists. They have it all.

1133
01:58:15,129 --> 01:58:19,509
On the other side of the city the ground rises to the ridge above the hypocenter.

1134
01:58:19,534 --> 01:58:24,658
A splinter unit will take this tunnel from the city to the floor of the hypocenter.

1135
01:58:24,683 --> 01:58:27,384
Blue Team located an entrance here.

1136
01:58:27,409 --> 01:58:29,607
The bomb is in this rock.

1137
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:33,722
High above. Will trigger a collapse, sealing the cavern.

1138
01:58:33,747 --> 01:58:38,050
How do we defuse the bomb up there? - We don't. The explosion takes place as planned.

1139
01:58:38,075 --> 01:58:41,963
Now our job is to fail to defuse that bomb,

1140
01:58:41,988 --> 01:58:45,790
while the splinter unit achieves its task undetected.

1141
01:58:45,815 --> 01:58:48,584
Which is? - "Need to know" and you don't.

1142
01:58:48,609 --> 01:58:53,648
Any other stupid questions? Good. Let's go. Let's get ready.

1143
01:58:56,015 --> 01:58:59,184
I wanted to be in the first wave. - There is no first wave.

1144
01:58:59,209 --> 01:59:01,896
Red Team and Blue Team operate simultaneously.

1145
01:59:01,921 --> 01:59:05,934
Look, don't get on the chopper if you can't stop thinking in linear terms.

1146
01:59:05,959 --> 01:59:09,259
Now you want to be on the team that lifts the contents of the capsule?

1147
01:59:09,284 --> 01:59:12,628
Absolutely. - Yeah, That's us.

1148
01:59:13,398 --> 01:59:16,612
We're the splinter unit. - Just us?

1149
01:59:16,637 --> 01:59:20,183
No one who knows the contents of that capsule can leave the field.

1150
01:59:20,777 --> 01:59:23,766
I thought we'd manage ourselves.

1151
01:59:32,930 --> 01:59:36,530
It's 40 feet from the private deck to the water. Can you jump it?

1152
01:59:36,555 --> 01:59:38,179
I can dive it.

1153
01:59:38,204 --> 01:59:41,079
Until you see my signal, you don't let him die.

1154
02:00:16,505 --> 02:00:18,492
30 seconds!

1155
02:00:58,742 --> 02:01:00,952
Move, move, move!

1156
02:01:11,751 --> 02:01:14,757
We're coming in on a shock wave. Hang on people!

1157
02:01:24,082 --> 02:01:25,409
On your feet!

1158
02:01:53,436 --> 02:01:56,777
Ma'am, we thought you'd gone ashore. - Well, I snuck back to surprise Andrei.

1159
02:01:57,001 --> 02:01:58,991
The boss left.

1160
02:01:59,592 --> 02:02:01,597
Have Mr. Sator find me here.

1161
02:02:01,711 --> 02:02:04,031
And don't tell the others. I'll get the mess.

1162
02:03:11,877 --> 02:03:13,883
My! - Mine!

1163
02:03:28,453 --> 02:03:33,541
They told me you'd gone ashore. - They told me you'd flown off.

1164
02:03:33,566 --> 02:03:38,564
I came back to see you and Max. - Max is onshore with Anna.

1165
02:03:38,905 --> 02:03:43,777
We need time, just you and me, after what happened. - I was joking. It was a stupid joke.

1166
02:03:43,802 --> 02:03:45,298
You think I'm a terrible mother.

1167
02:03:45,323 --> 02:03:49,313
We both know my opinion of you is higher than yours of me.

1168
02:03:56,918 --> 02:03:59,927
I want things to be better, Andrei.

1169
02:04:14,756 --> 02:04:16,757
Take cover!

1170
02:04:20,399 --> 02:04:23,643
Get me a god damn AT4! Take him out! Now!

1171
02:04:23,952 --> 02:04:28,954
Get out from cover! Move! Move! Let's go! Move, move!

1172
02:05:39,197 --> 02:05:41,187
Wheeler!

1173
02:05:42,023 --> 02:05:44,033
Get out! - Come on!

1174
02:05:50,031 --> 02:05:51,049
Ives!

1175
02:05:52,812 --> 02:05:54,822
The splinter unit. Here.

1176
02:05:56,292 --> 02:05:58,845
You know it's going to be a beautiful sunset.

1177
02:05:58,870 --> 02:06:02,908
I'll get Max's boat back. We should share the moment with him.

1178
02:06:03,220 --> 02:06:05,222
I'll make you a drink.

1179
02:06:06,311 --> 02:06:08,313
Bring my son back to the boat.

1180
02:06:14,632 --> 02:06:18,622
We're running out of time. Let's go! - If they see us, it's all for nothing

1181
02:06:22,019 --> 02:06:24,808
We need a distraction. - Don't worry about it.

1182
02:06:28,494 --> 02:06:30,482
On my mark!

1183
02:06:32,715 --> 02:06:37,165
RPG, fire at the base! - That building on my mark!

1184
02:06:38,629 --> 02:06:42,626
Three! Two! - One! Fire!

1185
02:06:43,329 --> 02:06:45,323
Fire!

1186
02:06:59,427 --> 02:07:02,419
Move! Move!

1187
02:07:16,567 --> 02:07:19,562
No going back now. Come on.

1188
02:07:25,003 --> 02:07:29,012
What's that? - I borrowed it from the CIA.

1189
02:07:30,248 --> 02:07:33,829
What is it? - The way the world ends.

1190
02:07:33,854 --> 02:07:37,822
Not with a bang, but a whimper. - I don't understand.

1191
02:07:38,581 --> 02:07:41,249
When I take this, It's all over.

1192
02:07:41,472 --> 02:07:43,522
Then don't take it yet.

1193
02:07:46,383 --> 02:07:48,386
Why not?

1194
02:07:50,048 --> 02:07:53,680
Because we have the sunset coming, and a little Vodka left.

1195
02:07:54,752 --> 02:07:56,507
And Max will be here soon.

1196
02:07:56,978 --> 02:08:00,998
They said they thought it was you, not Anna, ashore with Max.

1197
02:08:03,528 --> 02:08:07,518
So long as you can tell the difference...

1198
02:08:09,379 --> 02:08:12,387
A moment's business, my love.

1199
02:08:23,880 --> 02:08:28,903
Mahir, do you copy? Not clear! I repeat: Not clear!

1200
02:08:28,928 --> 02:08:33,459
Copy that. - I repeat: Not clear!

1201
02:08:59,644 --> 02:09:02,646
Neil! Neil!

1202
02:09:15,399 --> 02:09:16,417
Go!

1203
02:09:25,522 --> 02:09:28,504
We don't have anything big enough to blow this.

1204
02:09:34,541 --> 02:09:37,314
Try him. See if he's got a grenade.

1205
02:09:40,425 --> 02:09:42,942
Anything? - No, nothing.

1206
02:09:42,967 --> 02:09:44,968
Keep trying. Can you pick it?

1207
02:09:45,798 --> 02:09:49,033
I hope not. I paid a lot for that lock.

1208
02:09:49,185 --> 02:09:52,012
How do you like where my journey began and yours ends?

1209
02:09:52,037 --> 02:09:56,665
A little radioactive for my taste. - My fate was always bound up in radiation.

1210
02:09:57,868 --> 02:10:02,879
It worked where no one else would. I made a bargain with the devil.

1211
02:10:03,359 --> 02:10:07,104
Money for time. We sold our futures.

1212
02:10:07,129 --> 02:10:10,507
And now You're about to make the same mistake, for the entire world.

1213
02:10:10,532 --> 02:10:14,203
It wasn't a mistake. I made the bargain I got. What was yours?

1214
02:10:14,227 --> 02:10:18,105
You fight for a cause you barely understand,

1215
02:10:18,462 --> 02:10:21,842
with people you trust so little you've told them nothing.

1216
02:10:21,867 --> 02:10:24,111
When I die, the world dies with me.

1217
02:10:24,136 --> 02:10:27,325
And your knowledge dies with you, buried in a tomb,

1218
02:10:27,350 --> 02:10:29,572
like an anonymous Egyptian builder,

1219
02:10:29,597 --> 02:10:35,883
sealed in a pyramid to keep his secret. Your faith is blind. You're a fanatic.

1220
02:10:55,991 --> 02:10:58,231
What's more fanatical than trying to destroy the world?

1221
02:10:58,256 --> 02:11:00,750
I'm not. I'm creating a new one.

1222
02:11:01,370 --> 02:11:05,110
Somewhere, some time, a man in a crystaline tower throws a switch...

1223
02:11:05,590 --> 02:11:09,565
and Armageddon is both triggered and avoided.

1224
02:11:09,613 --> 02:11:12,982
Now time itself switches direction.

1225
02:11:13,007 --> 02:11:19,510
The same sunshine we basked in will warm the faces of our descendants generations to come.

1226
02:11:19,535 --> 02:11:21,262
How come they want to kill us?

1227
02:11:21,286 --> 02:11:25,127
Because their oceans rose and their rivers ran dry.

1228
02:11:25,152 --> 02:11:30,980
don't you see, they had no choice but to turn back. We're responsible.

1229
02:11:44,771 --> 02:11:47,865
Knowing this, do you still want me to stop?

1230
02:11:48,441 --> 02:11:52,488
Yes. Each generation looks after its own survival.

1231
02:11:52,513 --> 02:11:56,403
That's exactly what they're doing. - But not you. You're a traitor.

1232
02:11:56,428 --> 02:11:59,408
Bringing death to all because you have no life of your own left.

1233
02:11:59,776 --> 02:12:03,334
When I'm done, life continues. - Not your son's.

1234
02:12:03,535 --> 02:12:06,908
My greatest sin was to bring a son into a world I knew was ending.

1235
02:12:07,602 --> 02:12:09,621
Do you think God will forgive me?

1236
02:12:14,931 --> 02:12:15,935
Wait!

1237
02:12:17,108 --> 02:12:18,109
Wait!

1238
02:12:31,749 --> 02:12:33,750
Cover me!

1239
02:12:41,124 --> 02:12:43,122
Go! Go! Go!

1240
02:12:44,953 --> 02:12:49,878
You don't believe in God, or the future, or anything outside of your own experience.

1241
02:12:49,903 --> 02:12:54,330
The rest is belief, and I don't have it.

1242
02:12:55,118 --> 02:12:58,964
Without it, You're not human. You're just a madman.

1243
02:12:59,455 --> 02:13:03,453
Or a God, of sorts. - Like I said...

1244
02:13:06,898 --> 02:13:10,736
don't do it. Jesus! - Our time is up.

1245
02:13:16,919 --> 02:13:19,038
I'll give your love to my wife.

1246
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:21,792
You're forgetting, I Haven't met her yet.

1247
02:13:22,088 --> 02:13:25,065
That's right. After you meet her, she dies.

1248
02:13:25,090 --> 02:13:28,080
I'll just give her my love instead.

1249
02:13:29,079 --> 02:13:30,093
Don't do it.

1250
02:13:31,245 --> 02:13:34,797
Volkov. Shoot him in the head.

1251
02:13:46,019 --> 02:13:48,417
Enough business, my love.

1252
02:13:52,166 --> 02:13:53,760
Ives!

1253
02:14:14,902 --> 02:14:17,896
You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?

1254
02:14:19,869 --> 02:14:22,207
But it sounds terribly important.

1255
02:14:24,470 --> 02:14:27,465
Where are you going? - Aren't you hot?

1256
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:47,219
What are you doing now? - Oh, I spilled sunscreen.

1257
02:14:47,556 --> 02:14:50,544
So what? - It's slippery.

1258
02:14:52,342 --> 02:14:54,705
Just come here.

1259
02:14:57,651 --> 02:15:00,648
Turn around. You'll like it.

1260
02:15:34,612 --> 02:15:38,262
I can't do this. I can't let you think you've won.

1261
02:15:38,287 --> 02:15:42,289
don't spoil this moment, Kat. - Not letting you go to your grave thinking We're coming with you.

1262
02:15:44,789 --> 02:15:46,366
You're dying alone, Andrei.

1263
02:15:46,391 --> 02:15:49,716
Come on, come on! - The gate is closed.

1264
02:15:50,438 --> 02:15:53,029
Mahir, do you copy? - Yeah.

1265
02:15:53,366 --> 02:15:55,850
Hold. I repeat: Hold.

1266
02:16:00,826 --> 02:16:02,474
Look in my eyes.

1267
02:16:03,511 --> 02:16:05,523
Which do you see?

1268
02:16:05,736 --> 02:16:08,646
Despair or anger?

1269
02:16:10,345 --> 02:16:15,340
I'm not the woman who can find love for you even though you scarred her on the inside.

1270
02:16:16,100 --> 02:16:20,036
I'm the vengeful bitch you scarred on the outside.

1271
02:16:22,908 --> 02:16:23,909
No!

1272
02:16:42,847 --> 02:16:44,528
Shit.

1273
02:16:44,553 --> 02:16:47,565
Ives, she killed him. Ives, do you copy? She killed him

1274
02:16:47,835 --> 02:16:50,312
She jumped the gun. She killed him.

1275
02:17:08,972 --> 02:17:10,986
Come on! Come on!

1276
02:17:15,679 --> 02:17:17,230
Up the ass with it.

1277
02:18:27,691 --> 02:18:30,086
Kat, you jumped the gun!

1278
02:18:30,499 --> 02:18:34,036
I couldn't do it! I couldn't let him die thinking he'd won.

1279
02:18:34,382 --> 02:18:39,090
I knew you'd find a way. Wait. You found a way. We're okay, right?

1280
02:18:39,115 --> 02:18:42,117
Yeah. I found a way. We're safe.

1281
02:19:03,215 --> 02:19:07,712
I thought you were inverted. - I changed gears halfway.

1282
02:19:07,959 --> 02:19:11,963
Looked like you needed help here. - Yeah. We needed help down there.

1283
02:19:13,275 --> 02:19:14,732
How did you get that lock open?

1284
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:17,868
It wasn't me. didn't your team need you?

1285
02:19:18,685 --> 02:19:21,143
I'll get them on the next pass.

1286
02:19:21,289 --> 02:19:24,298
You right, Ives? - Once I've caught my breath.

1287
02:19:38,719 --> 02:19:41,707
No one who's seen this leaves the field.

1288
02:19:49,954 --> 02:19:50,967
Right.

1289
02:19:54,892 --> 02:19:56,875
We hide it.

1290
02:19:57,089 --> 02:19:59,074
We end our lives.

1291
02:19:59,422 --> 02:20:02,422
It's the only way to be sure.

1292
02:20:03,413 --> 02:20:05,388
As to when...

1293
02:20:05,658 --> 02:20:08,656
Maybe that's every man's decision to make for himself.

1294
02:20:09,153 --> 02:20:12,781
You're not going to kill us? - If I ever find you, I will.

1295
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:14,795
You won't look too hard?

1296
02:20:15,599 --> 02:20:18,591
Yes, I will.

1297
02:20:20,515 --> 02:20:25,512
You're not going back to London to check on Kat, are you? - No. It's far too dangerous.

1298
02:20:26,072 --> 02:20:28,296
Even from afar?

1299
02:20:28,905 --> 02:20:30,919
Even from afar.

1300
02:20:32,627 --> 02:20:36,617
Ives! Wait.

1301
02:20:42,285 --> 02:20:44,294
Are you really going back in?

1302
02:20:46,764 --> 02:20:48,784
I'm the only one who can get that door open in time, right, Ives?

1303
02:20:49,921 --> 02:20:51,941
I don't know any locksmiths as good as you.

1304
02:20:53,896 --> 02:20:56,916
See? It's me in there again.

1305
02:20:58,142 --> 02:21:01,143
Weaving another past in the fabric of this mission.

1306
02:21:09,718 --> 02:21:10,739
Neil, wait!

1307
02:21:14,974 --> 02:21:19,019
We just saved the world. can't leave anything to chance.

1308
02:21:19,646 --> 02:21:22,171
But can we change things if we do it differently?

1309
02:21:22,426 --> 02:21:23,978
What's happened happened.

1310
02:21:24,995 --> 02:21:27,545
Which is an expression of faith in the mechanics of the world.

1311
02:21:28,688 --> 02:21:30,536
It's not an excuse to do nothing.

1312
02:21:31,141 --> 02:21:33,138
Fate? - Call it what you want.

1313
02:21:33,642 --> 02:21:36,645
What do you call it? - Reality.

1314
02:21:39,161 --> 02:21:41,167
Now, let me go.

1315
02:21:46,250 --> 02:21:48,571
Hey, you never did tell me who recruited you, Neil.

1316
02:21:48,986 --> 02:21:50,943
Haven't you guessed by now?

1317
02:21:51,825 --> 02:21:55,569
You did! Only not when you thought.

1318
02:21:56,016 --> 02:21:57,583
You have a future in the past.

1319
02:21:58,585 --> 02:22:01,586
Years ago for me. Years from now for you.

1320
02:22:02,598 --> 02:22:04,291
You've known me for years?

1321
02:22:05,953 --> 02:22:08,975
For me, I think It's the end of a beautiful friendship.

1322
02:22:09,767 --> 02:22:13,599
But for me, It's just the beginning. - We get up to some stuff.

1323
02:22:14,597 --> 02:22:17,587
You're going to love it. You'll see.

1324
02:22:17,935 --> 02:22:19,977
This whole operation is a temporal pincer.

1325
02:22:20,712 --> 02:22:21,730
Whose?

1326
02:22:23,366 --> 02:22:29,355
Yours! You're only halfway there. I'll see you at the beginning, friend.

1327
02:22:37,544 --> 02:22:40,260
We're the people saving the world from what might have been.

1328
02:22:40,861 --> 02:22:43,085
The world will never know what could have happened.

1329
02:22:44,568 --> 02:22:47,566
And even if they did, they wouldn't care.

1330
02:22:51,853 --> 02:22:56,911
Because no one cares about the bomb that didn't go off. Only the one that did.

1331
02:22:59,319 --> 02:23:02,311
Do it before the boy comes out.

1332
02:23:03,415 --> 02:23:06,639
That's your idea of mercy? You gave me your word.

1333
02:23:06,664 --> 02:23:09,646
And I told you then what it would be worth.

1334
02:23:10,082 --> 02:23:12,081
Here? Today?

1335
02:23:13,527 --> 02:23:16,521
How did you know?

1336
02:23:17,129 --> 02:23:19,833
Cannon Place, three o'clock. Probably nothing.

1337
02:23:20,047 --> 02:23:21,034
Posterity.

1338
02:23:21,159 --> 02:23:24,173
Cannon Place, three o'clock. Probably nothing.

1339
02:23:25,482 --> 02:23:28,666
I told you you'd have to start looking differently at the world.

1340
02:23:29,231 --> 02:23:32,309
I had to tie up the loose ends. - That was never your job.

1341
02:23:32,334 --> 02:23:34,666
Then whose was it? - Mine.

1342
02:23:34,690 --> 02:23:37,708
I realized I wasn't working for you. We've both been working for me.

1343
02:23:38,844 --> 02:23:40,467
I'm the protagonist.

1344
02:23:43,125 --> 02:23:46,124
Then you'd better tie up those loose ends.

1345
02:23:48,950 --> 02:23:50,957
Mission accomplished.

1346
02:23:52,623 --> 02:23:57,623
It's the bomb that didn't go off. The danger no one knew was real.
